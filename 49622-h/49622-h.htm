<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="author">BY G.J. JOHNSON.</p>

<p>This Handbook, being prepared for the use of the
members of the British Association, at their meeting in
Birmingham, in 1886, it is deemed desirable to preface it
by a very brief sketch of the progress of the town since
the first meeting here of the Association in 1839, a
period only three years short of half a century.</p>

<p><b>The Corporation.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></b>&mdash;When the Association met in
Birmingham, on the 26th of August, 1839, the Borough
had recently been incorporated&mdash;the first meeting of the
Town Council having been held on the 27th of the
previous December; but when the Council attempted to
exercise the power of making a Borough Rate, the Overseers
refused to levy it in consequence of objections which
had been raised to the validity of the Charter. In addition
to these pecuniary difficulties, the town was just
recovering from the effects of the Chartist riots, in the
Bull Ring, seven weeks before. The Corporation had
not the control of a single policeman or constable, and
the town was in charge of a body of London police.</p>

<p>The same day on which the Association met, the Royal
assent was given to an Act (2 and 3 Vic., c. 88), hurriedly
passed, to appoint a Commissioner of Police in the
Borough for two years, and to authorise an advance of
£10,000, for the purpose of organizing and paying a
police force.</p>

<p>The validity of the charter of incorporation was ultimately
settled by a statutory confirmation (5 and 6 Vic.,
c. III), which received the royal assent on the 12th of
August, 1842. As a consequence, the control of the
police was transferred to the Watch Committee of the
Corporation. At the time of the transfer the strength of
the force was 300 men, and the population of the borough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
183,000. The population is now about 427,000, and
the police force is 550 in number, and is both efficient
and adequate.</p>

<p>The great cost of conveying prisoners and lunatics to
the County Gaol and Asylum at Warwick, and the
inadequacy of both to the increasing population, rendered
the building of a Borough Gaol and Lunatic Asylum at
Winson Green a necessity, and as soon as the Corporation
obtained the control of the police the gaol was proceeded
with and opened in 1849. In the following year the
Lunatic Asylum was opened, to which was added, in 1882,
another Asylum at Rubery Hill, near Bromsgrove.</p>

<p>The year 1851 is memorable in our municipal history
for the vesting in the Corporation, for the first time, of
complete control over the entire borough by the transfer
to it of the conflicting powers and jurisdictions of the
other governing bodies (see pp. <a href="#Page_18">18</a> and <a href="#Page_19">19</a>.) Up to
that date the formation and maintenance of the streets,
roads, and footways of the town, the lighting and drainage,
and all the other important work now undertaken by
the Public Works Committee of the Corporation could
not be dealt with in any uniform system, because six
other governing bodies or officials had statutory powers
over the portions of the Borough which were outside the
<i>parish</i> of Birmingham. With the year 1852 a new and
uniform system commenced, and not an hour too soon,
having regard to the rapid increase of the population
and the consequent multiplication of new streets and
roads. The aspect of the town has been completely
changed in the paving of the roads and footways, the
lighting of the streets, the widening of many of the
principal thoroughfares, and the carrying into operation of
a complete and uniform system of drainage and sewerage.
To the Public Works Committee belongs also the
control of the numerous tramways which lead from
the centre of the town to the suburbs in every direction,
except the upper part of Edgbaston, the approach to
which is rendered difficult by the narrowness of Broad
Street. The improved system of drainage and sewerage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
brought to an issue the serious question of how the
sewage of the town was to be dealt with. From the year
1858 this had become a serious and increasing difficulty,
involving the Corporation in constant and costly litigation
with the neighbouring landowners, resulting in injunctions
from the Court of Chancery. In 1871 a special Committee
called “The Sewage Enquiry Committee” was
instituted, who recommended the course ultimately
adopted, viz.: the formation of a board representing the
whole drainage area, and the establishment of a large
sewage farm at Saltley. The latter was first undertaken
and found to be a solution of the difficulty, and in the
year 1877 the other object was attained by the constitution
of the “Birmingham Tame and Rea District Drainage
Board,” composed of twenty-two representatives from the
different governing bodies in the drainage area, of whom
twelve are elected by the Town Council of Birmingham.
To this body the sewage farm has been transferred, and
is now carried on with the most beneficial result.</p>

<p>Immediately after the passing of the Public Health
Act, 1872, the Borough was constituted an Urban
Sanitary District and the Council as the Urban Sanitary
Authority, set itself vigorously to the work of improving
the public health. A Borough Hospital for the treatment
of small pox and scarlet fever was established in 1874.
The Public Health Act, 1875, indirectly removed for
sanitary purposes the limit on rating powers to which the
Council were obliged to submit in their Act of 1851. By
the zealous labours of the Health Committee, and the
liberal application of the pecuniary resources placed at
its command by the Act of 1875, the death rate has been
reduced from 24.8 per 1,000 in 1874 to 19.1 in 1885,
although the mean density of the population has increased
in the same period 20 per cent.</p>

<p>In 1851 the first of the four sets of public baths was
opened in Kent Street, followed by other sets in
Woodcock Street (1860), Northwood Street (1862), and
Monument Road (1883). Under the management of the
same Committee of the Council are placed the ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
public parks and recreation grounds of the Borough, of
which five have been given to the Corporation and five
have been acquired by purchase. The list is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1860 the Free Libraries Act was adopted, and the
first branch library was opened in Constitution Hill, on
the 3rd of April, 1861. The first Central Lending
Library and Art Gallery were opened on the 6th Sept.,
1865, on the occasion of the meeting of the British
Association. (See for the subsequent history of the Free
Libraries <a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a> <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1863 the Borough Cemetery at Witton was
completed. (See <a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>.)</p>

<p>In 1874, a Fire Brigade was established, which now
consists of thirty well-trained men, with six engines, and
all suitable apparatus.</p>

<p>From the year 1851 to 1873 was a period of steady
progress in our municipal affairs; but the mayoralty of the
Right Hon. (then Mr.) Joseph Chamberlain, 1873-6, was
signalised by the building of the Council House; the
acquisition of the undertakings of the two Gas Companies
of the Borough, as well as that of the Waterworks Company,
and the authorisation of a great scheme of street
improvement of which the formation of Corporation Street
is the principal feature. Curiously enough, the acquisition
of the gas supply of the Borough had a consequence,
apparently as far removed as Tenterden steeple from the
Goodwin Sands, viz., the provision of the present
commodious Art Gallery (<a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>.) The explanation is,
that under the Free Libraries Act, the Town Council had
the power to appropriate the site for the purpose of an
Art Gallery, but no power to raise money to erect the
building otherwise than by the penny rate, which was then
hardly sufficient for the annual cost of the Free Libraries.
The Gas department of the Corporation requiring to build
larger offices, the Council, at the request of the Free
Libraries Committee, granted the land to the Gas Committee,
on condition that they should build over their
offices the new Art Gallery, which they have done at
an estimated cost of £40,000. By this means a difficulty
which seemed insuperable was overcome. In addition to
this benefit to the town, the Gas Committee have earned
for the Corporation a profit of more than £25,000 a year.</p>

<p>Thirty years of municipal activity, such as has been
described, commencing with the Act of 1851, of course
involved repeated applications to Parliament, and in 1882
the mass of legislation was found to be enormous, and a
consolidation of twenty separate Acts was effected by the
Birmingham (Corporation) Consolidation Act, 1883, which
removed the limit of the Free Library rate, and enabled
the Corporation to establish the Municipal School of Art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
(see <a href="#Page_xviii">p. xviii.</a>), and to provide adequate funds for the
maintenance of the Corporation Art Gallery.</p>

<p>Thus the same Corporation which, in 1839, had no
revenue, nor means of obtaining any, and required to be
assisted by the Government with a loan of £10,000 for
police purposes, in the year 1885, levied rates for municipal
purposes (exclusive of poor’s rate and the School
Board rate) to the amount of £318,882, being 4s. 5d.
in the pound on the annual value of the rateable
property of the borough, and now borrows money readily
at three-and-a-quarter per cent. Its revenue, and the
income received from some of the Committees, sufficed to
keep the operations of the Corporation in working order,
and to pay the interest on £7,606,269&mdash;the aggregate
amount of the liabilities on capital account on 31st December,
1885. With reference to this large amount of indebtedness
it should be noted that £2,720,061 is the capitalized
value at twenty-five years’ purchase of the annuities
granted as the purchase moneys of the Birmingham and
Staffordshire Gas Company, and the Water Works
Company, and that £450,000 was paid in cash for the
purchase of The Birmingham Gas Company, and also
that £1,520,567 has been expended on the Improvement
Scheme. This reduces the sum still due for the debts
of the former governing bodies and all the public works
executed by the Corporation since 1839, to £2,915,630,
and there can be no doubt that the whole of the indebtedness
is more than balanced by the value of the
property belonging to the Corporation.</p>

<p>It remains to be noticed that the Corporation is the
largest landowner in the Borough, owning more than
2,000 acres of land (including its share of the sewage
farm) and is the largest employer of labour, employing
upwards of 4,000 persons. Also that in July, 1884, Birmingham
was made an assize town; whereupon the Town
Council took into immediate consideration the necessity
of building Courts for Assizes, Quarter Sessions and Petty
Sessions, and in July, 1886, approved of plans for the
purpose. The “New Law Courts” as they are termed,
will be erected in Corporation Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

Borough was estimated at 180,000. The following is the

<p>In 1871 (the year after the Telegraphs were transferred to the
Post Office), the number of Telegraph Messages dealt with was
1,081,825, and in 1885-6, 3,111,662. The number of Parcels dealt
with in 1885-6 was 2,492,689.</p>

<p><b>Gifts for public purposes.</b>&mdash;“More than princely,
<i>civic</i> munificence” was a happy phrase of Professor Max
Müller on the occasion of the opening of the Mason
Science College, and it is certain that in proportion as the
feeling of citizenship in any community becomes strong
it will manifest itself in the establishment or assistance
of institutions for public purposes. Birmingham has
never been without examples of this kind. The earliest of
the existing charities of the town is&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Lench’s Trust</b>, originated by a feoffment, 11th March,
1525, by William Lench, of lands in and near Birmingham
to trustees. With this trust many other smaller gifts
have been incorporated, and the income of the whole is
now applied to the maintenance of four sets of almshouses
for aged women, in Conybere Street, Hospital Street,
Ladywood Road, and Ravenhurst Street. The total
number of inmates is 178, and each of them has a house
and four shillings a week. The income of this charity
has grown with the growth of the town like that of the
Grammar School (see <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>.) In 1839 it was £758,
in 1886 it is £3,085.</p>

<p>The next endowment in order of time was that of the
Free Grammar School (see <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>) to which has since been
added one half of the endowment of Milward’s Charity
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1684). Then came&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Fentham’s Charity</b> (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1712), part of the revenue
of which is appropriated to the maintenance of certain
boys in the Blue Coat School, distinguished by a dark
green dress.</p>

<p>With the exception of a number of smaller charities for
apprenticing boys, relieving poor widows, giving doles of
bread, no important public benefactions were bestowed
for nearly a century. Almshouses in imitation of Lench’s
Trust, twenty in number, were built by Joseph Dowell,
in Warner Street, in 1820, and another set by Mrs. Glover,
in Steelhouse Lane, for thirty-six aged women, in 1832.</p>

<p>The last twenty years have been fruitful in gifts by our
wealthier citizens beginning with&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Evans’ Cottage Homes</b>, Founded in 1867, by
Alfred Smith Evans (of the then well-known firm of Evans
and Askin), are six cottages at Selly Oak, of a superior
kind to the ordinary almshouse, for ladies of reduced
means. Each inmate is required to possess an income of
£25 a year, and receives £20 a year from the trust.
Vacancies in the trustees are supplied by magistrates of
the borough, appointed by the Town Council.</p>

<p><b>The Orphanage</b> and <b>Almshouses</b> at Erdington,
completed in 1868, at a cost of £60,000, by the late Sir
Josiah (then Josiah) Mason, and endowed with an annual
income from landed property, which in 1885 produced
£6,400. The Orphanage contains upwards of 300
children, in the proportion of two girls to one boy. The
Almshouses contain 30 poor women. Seven of the
fourteen trustees are appointed by the Town Council.</p>

<p><b>Crowley’s Orphanage.</b>&mdash;Thomas Crowley, a timber
merchant, of Birmingham, who died 28th February, 1869,
by deed dated 15th February, 1869, settled £10,000
upon trusts to educate poor orphan girls. No orphanage
has yet been built, but temporary homes have been
opened in Ladywood Road.</p>

<p><b>The James’ Trust.</b>&mdash;The Misses Elizabeth and
Emma James, by deed dated 1st November, 1869,
conveyed a freehold estate in Paradise Street, as an endowment
for “The James’ Almhouses” they had built at
Nechells for aged women, to provide five annuities of
£20 each for poor and decayed gentlewomen, and a
scholarship of £50 a year from the Free Grammar
School at Birmingham to the Universities of Oxford
or Cambridge. The net income is about £750 per
annum, the surplus beyond £450 per annum is to be
accumulated, and applied in building additional almshouses.</p>

<p><b>The Public Picture Gallery Fund</b> originated in a
gift in the year 1871, by Mr. T. Clarkson Osler (of the
well-known firm of glass manufacturers) of a sum of
£3,000 for the purchase of pictures for the Corporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
Art Gallery. This sum is augmented by other donations
and amounts subscribed, and has been the means of
adorning the Art Gallery with many valuable pictures.</p>

<p><b>Dudley Trust.</b>&mdash;Mr. William Dudley, a Jeweller of
Birmingham, by deed dated 8th May, 1875, settled
£100,000 in the hands of Trustees to be used in (1)
Loans to young tradesmen at low rates of interest; (2)
Annuities to aged tradesmen, and (3) Surplus to be
applied in aid of the charitable institutions of the
Borough. Four of the Trustees are to be appointed by
the Town Council.</p>

<p><b>Free Libraries.</b>&mdash;In order of time reference should
be made to the fund of nearly £15,000 raised in 1879
to refurnish the Reference Library after the fire, and to
the valuable gifts of books detailed at <a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a> <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p><b>The Art Gallery Purchase Fund</b> originated in an
offer of Messrs. Tangye, on 3rd July, 1880, to contribute
£5,000 to a fund for the purchase of examples of art for
the New Art Gallery, since built by the Gas Committee
as previously stated (<a href="#Page_xiii">p. xiii.</a>), and a further £5,000 on
condition that an equal sum was raised by public subscription.
The sum of £7,000 additional was raised and
placed at the disposal of a Special Committee of the
Town Council, called the “Art Gallery Purchase
Committee.”</p>

<p><b>The Mason Science College.</b>&mdash;For a full account
of which (see <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>), was opened 1st October, 1880. Its
cost was £60,000, and it is endowed with landed property
producing £3,600 per annum. Of the eleven Trustees,
five are appointed by the Town Council.</p>

<p><b>The Wilkes Bequest.</b>&mdash;Mr. Alfred Salt Wilkes, a
Manufacturer in Birmingham, who died on the 29th July,
1881, left a sum of money expected to realise £98,000
for division, after two life interests, between the Birmingham
and Midland Institute and the General Hospital.</p>

<p><b>Municipal School of Art.</b>&mdash;On the 9th of November,
1881, the retiring Mayor, Mr. Richard Chamberlain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
announced to the Council that Miss Ryland had offered
£10,000, Messrs. Richard and George Tangye, another
£10,000 (afterwards increased to £10,937), and Mr.
Cregoe Colmore a piece of land worth £14,000 for the
building of the present School of Art. The foundation
stone was laid 31st March, 1884, by Mr. Richard Tangye,
and the building (see <a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a>) finished and opened on
14th September, 1885. The former School of Art, a
voluntary association supported by public subscription
(and to which Miss Ryland had been a generous donor)
being transferred to the Corporation.</p>

<p><b>The Princess Alice Orphanage</b>, at Chester Road,
was established, 1882, partly by a donation of £10,000
by Mr. Solomon Jevons, of Birmingham.</p>

<p><b>The Lloyds’ Almshouses</b>, in Belgrave Road, were
founded by the widow of Mr. James Lloyd, a banker, of
Birmingham.</p>

<p><b>The Jaffray Suburban Hospital</b>, at Erdington,
for the treatment of chronic and non-contagious cases
in connection with the Birmingham General Hospital,
is the latest, but not the least of the gifts to the
town. It was built and furnished at the sole cost of Mr.
John Jaffray, and opened on the 27th November, 1885.</p>

<p>An enumeration of these gifts would not be complete
without reference to the five gifts of public parks particularised
in the list at <a href="#Page_xii">page xii</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to these benefactions, mention ought to be
made of the numerous gifts of pictures, sculptures and
bronzes, given to the Art Gallery by our leading citizens,
which will be found detailed in the Art Gallery Catalogue.
Five of these gifts are deserving of special
mention, namely, (1) the collection of arms given 17th
August, 1876, by the Guardians of the Birmingham Proof
House, and now arranged in the south gallery; (2) the
collection of pictures of David Cox given by the late
J. H. Nettlefold; (3) Müller’s well known “Prayers in
the Desert,” and others given by the Rt. Hon. Joseph
Chamberlain; (4) a collection of Wedgwood ware given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
by Messrs. Richard and George Tangye; and (5) the
clock in the tower of the Art Gallery given by Mr. Follett
Osler, F.R.S. Now that so admirable a gallery has been
provided for the reception of such gifts, it may be
confidently hoped that others equally valuable will be
constantly added by the public spirit and liberality of the
citizens of Birmingham.</p>

<p>It is computed that the value of these and other smaller
gifts for public purposes for the last twenty years
approaches, if it does not exceed, one million sterling.</p>

<p><b>Hospital Sunday and Saturday Collections.</b>&mdash;The
suggestion of a collection in the churches and
chapels of the town on the last Sunday in October, for
the medical charities was made by the Midland Counties’
Herald Newspaper, October, 1859. It was warmly taken
up by the then Rector of Birmingham, Dr. Miller, and
has been continued annually since 27th October, 1859.
The total sum contributed up to and including the collection
in October, 1885, is £124,433, the average for
twenty-seven years being £4,608.</p>

<p><b>Hospital Saturday Collection.</b>&mdash;The first Hospital
Saturday Collection, designed to reach a class differing
from the contributors to the Hospital Sunday Collection,
took place March 15th, 1873. It has gradually grown in
amount, and now produces a larger annual sum than the
Hospital Sunday Collection. The amount raised in
fourteen years is £63,250, or an average of £4,517.
The last collection produced £6,521.</p>

<p><b>Clubs.</b>&mdash;Small clubs, meeting at stated times for
social purposes, were always common in Birmingham.
The Bean Club, which meets annually, has existed since
1660. The “parlours” of the better class of public
houses were places where tradesmen used to assemble in
the evenings and were social clubs in the old sense. In
1840 the present Waterloo Rooms, now occupied by the
Midland Conservative Club, were built for a club house,
but the time was not ripe and they were let to the Government
for the Old Bankruptcy Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Union Club</span> (non-political) was the first club
in the modern sense, and was established in 1856, in
rooms in Bennett’s Hill, and succeeded so well that the
present club-house, at the corner of Colmore Row and
Newhall Street, was built for it, and the club removed
there in May, 1869.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Midland Club</span>, in New Street, was established
in the year 1869, and is a non-political club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Conservative Club</span> was established in 1872.

club house in Temple Row is being built.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Liberal Club</span> was established in the year 1877,
in New Street, and in November, 1885, was removed to the
stately building at the corner of Congreve Street and
Edmund Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Reform Club</span> was established in the year 1879,
under the title of the Junior Liberal Club. It occupies
rooms in New Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Midland Conservative Club</span>, which now

established in the year 1882.</p>

Association during the meeting of 1886, on presentation
of their cards of membership.</p>

<p>The matters touched upon in this Introduction must
be regarded as illustrative of the progress of the town in
a few particulars which did not fall within any of the
divisions of Part II. of this Handbook (see Table of
Contents). Fully to realize the development in every
direction of our municipal, educational, ecclesiastical,
literary, artistic, and industrial life, the whole of that part
should be consulted. The remainder of the book will
shew how assiduously various branches of science are
cultivated amongst us.</p>

HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES.<br />
1086&mdash;1800.</h2>

<p class="author">BY SAM: TIMMINS.</p>

<p><b>Origin of Name.</b>&mdash;Eight hundred years ago the
name of Birmingham first appeared in history, and almost
exactly with the present name of the town. In the famous
Domesday Book (1083-1086), compiled for William the
Norman, the name is spelled “Bermingeha’,” but the
varieties of spelling, from the conquest, have been remarkable.
Some curious collector has summed up one hundred
and forty variations, but most of these may be resolved
into two forms of pronunciation&mdash;either Birmingham or
Bromicham. It is curious that no other town or village
in England seems to have a similar name to that of
Birmingham, and hence its etymology is somewhat
obscure. Hutton’s favourite origin was Broom from the
plant, Wych, a dwelling or a descent, and Ham a home,
so that Bromwycham was supposed to be the original
name indicating local details; but Hutton had forgotten
to look at Domesday Book, or to explain how Bromwycham
had been turned into Birmingham. Still more, he had
neglected Dugdale’s remark that while “ham,” for home,
explained the final syllable, the other two syllables certainly
denoted some personal name. All later researches have
tended to confirm this suggestion, and modern philologists,
including Prof. E. A. Freeman, are almost unanimous in
agreeing that “Berm,” or “Beorm,” or some similar form
represents the name of some Saxon tribe or people, and
that Bermingham would be a patronymic or family name,
with the “ing” or “iung” denoting some progeny or tribe,
and giving the name to the “de Berminghams,” who
flourished in the place, as Dugdale fully shows.</p>

<p><b>Early History.</b>&mdash;As to the ante-Norman holders,
Dugdale says on the authority of Domesday Book, that in
“Edward the Confessor’s days (Birmingham was) the
freehold of one Ulvvine,” but the history begins with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Domesday Book which gives the following details:&mdash;“Richard
holds of William (Fitz Ausculf) four hides in
Bermingha’. The arable employs six ploughs; one is
in the demesne. There are five villeins and four bordars
with two ploughs. Wood half a mile long, and four
furlongs broad. It was, and is worth 20s.” These
few facts compare very favourably with the description
of other places, and show that Birmingham was
then a place of some importance. No church is mentioned,
and no priest, but those omissions do not
necessarily prove that the place had neither, and probably
it had both. The extent of the “hide” is very uncertain
and it seems to have varied from sixty to one hundred acres.
This entry obviously relates to Birmingham only, and
Edgbaston, Aston, and other places are similarly
described. This extract is merely given to show that
some sort of town existed long before 1083-1086, and
that its name was nearly as we spell and sound it now.</p>

<p>After Domesday Book a long blank occurs, except as
to certain documentary evidence as to Fairs, (1166 and
1251), and the help given to Simon de Montfort against
Henry III., by William de Bermingham. But a little
light is thrown on the condition of Birmingham by
further examination of a curious and unique old map
of England and Scotland now in the Bodleian Library,
but which was known to Gough and included in his
Topography, (Vol. I., p. 77,) with an engraving by Basire,
which, however, is very imperfect and inaccurate. A
photo-zincograph of this ancient map was produced by
the Ordnance Office in 1875, with a description by
Mr. W. Basevi Saunders, who settles the date of the map
as <i>circa</i> 1286-1300. In this map, which is remarkably
interesting but ludicrously wrong in many parts, especially
as to Scotland, Birmingham distinctly appears. Cathedral
cities and large churches are generally indicated,
rivers are marked, and even miles on roads, while a large
number of single houses are marked to show towns, when
no names are given. In the portion marked “Ardene”
one house, with “Brmynghā,” clearly appears between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Worcester and Lichfield, and is the only town in Warwickshire
which is described by name, not even Coventry
or Warwick being named. This seems to show that
Birmingham was a place of some importance even six
hundred years ago, and that its name was then spelled
nearly as now, the abbreviations probably indicating
“Bermyngham.”</p>

<p>As Dugdale’s Warwickshire is generally limited to the
territorial and family history, which is difficult to condense,
and rarely refers to the existence or state of the buildings
in his time, there is very little material for the history of
the town for several centuries. He mentions, however,
that Peter de Bermingham “had a Castle here which
stood nearre a Bow-shoot from the Church south-westwards”
(12 Henry II., 1166), doubtless on the site of
Smithfield market, which had buildings and moat till
1815. A market was granted by the same king, and on
Thursdays, and was probably largely frequented and
helped the progress of the town. From this de Bermingham
family, Dugdale says, “doubtless came the de
Berminghams of Ireland, who settled there very antiently:
perhaps in Hen. II. days on the first conquest of that
realm by Ric. Strongbow:” but the family connection
with Birmingham ended with Edward and his tragic
story in 1545.</p>

<p><b>The Priory.</b>&mdash;The Hospital or Priory of St. Thomas
the Apostle has had its name and site preserved by the
names “Upper and Lower Priory,” “Minories,” &amp;c., but
the exact site of the buildings and the date of the foundation
are uncertain. The grounds occupied a large
space along Bull Street, Dale End, John Street, and
Steelhouse Lane; but even in the recent excavations for
new streets scarcely a fragment has been found. A century
ago the pseudo-antiquarian William Hutton, who
did his best to write a History of Birmingham, records
that in 1775 he removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> “twenty waggon loads of old
stones, great numbers of which were highly finished in
the Gothic taste; parts of porticos, windows, arches,
ceilings&mdash;some fluted, some ciphered, yet complete as the
day they left the chisel,” and that after letting the
builders destroy the greater portion, he used some in
making a fire-place in “an under-ground kitchen.” There
is little hope now of finding any of these relics or of
settling the site on which the Priory buildings stood. Even
Dugdale failed to find its origin, and simply records that the
first mention occurs in 13 Edwd. I. (1285), and that the
Commissioners of Henry VIII. (1545) valued it at
£8. 8s. 10d., and that it was duly dissolved.</p>

<p><b>St. Martin’s Church.</b>&mdash;The Mother Church, St.
Martin’s, claims great antiquity, but its exact date has not
been found. During the recent restoration some early wall-paintings
were discovered, with the still more valuable
remains which formed part of a Norman Church, very
evidently on the same site, but all traces of whose history
have been lost. The existing Church has, however,
some highly interesting monuments of some of the de
Berminghams of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
centuries, one in alabaster, representing an ecclesiastic,
being well known as an almost unique example of fifteenth
century art. The present restored church has replaced an
ugly brick casing which covered the decaying portion of
an earlier church supposed to have been of the latter
part of the thirteenth century with later alterations. The
Registers begin in 1555, and have been carefully
preserved, as well as various Church Books which have
been used in the History of St. Martin’s by Mr. J.
Thackray Bunce.</p>

<p><b>St. John’s Chapel.</b>&mdash;Another ecclesiastical relic, in
name only, is to be found in the ugly last century brick
building, St. John’s Chapel, Deritend, which has replaced
the “propper chappel,” which Leland saw in 1538, an early
English building among the trees by the river side. This
“chapel” was founded in 1375, by some of the inhabitants
of Deritend and Bordesley, who found the floods often
preventing access to their Parish Church at Aston.
Thirteen of the inhabitants of the hamlets contributed
the funds, and acquired the right of “appointing one
Chaplain” for the services, and such Chaplain is appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to this day by the parishioners’ votes. Tradition records
that John Rogers, one of the early translators of the
Bible, and the first Martyr of the reign of Mary, was
born in Deritend near this Chapel, and a marble slab
records his fame, but the tradition is doubtful, and has
not been fully confirmed.</p>

<p><b>The Guild of the Holy Cross</b>, whose Hall was on
the site of the present King Edward’s School, was founded
in 6 Rich. II. (1382), for the maintenance of two priests
to celebrate service daily in the Church of St. Martin, but
ten years later was formed into a “Guild or Fraternitie,
consisting of men and women of Birmingham,” in the
names of the “Bailiffs and Communaltie of Birmingham
and other adjacent places, for a Chantrie of priests and
services in the Church, for the souls of the Founders and
all the Fraternitie,” but in 37 Hen. VIII. (1545) the lands
were valued at £31. 2s. 10d., and appropriated by the
Crown, and afterwards, 5 Edw. VI. (1550), were used for
the foundation of the “Free Grammar School of King
Edward the Sixth, for the Education and Instruction of
Children in Grammar for ever,”&mdash;the basis of the present
noble foundation, not only in New Street, but in several
important Branch Schools.</p>

<p><b>Leland’s Description, 1538.</b>&mdash;Nearly half of the sixteenth
century had passed before Birmingham was
visited and described by any stranger, and the visit
of John Leland is a memorable landmark in the history
of the town. His few words are familiar but worth
quoting again, not merely as a record, but as a contrast
with the changed conditions of over three hundred
years. In the reign of Henry VIII., he made his famous
journey through England, and in 1538 he visited
Birmingham and rode through the town, which he
describes in picturesque words:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>“I came through a
pretty street or ever I entred into Bermingham towne.
This street, as I remember, is called Dirtey [Deriten].
In it dwell smithes and cutlers, and there is a brooke
[Rea] that divideth this street from Bermingham, and is
an hamlett or member belonginge to the Parish therebye.
There is at the end of Dirtey a propper chappell and
mansion house of tymber, hard on the rype [bank] as the
brooke runneth downe: and as I went through the ford
by the [foot] bridge, the water ranne downe on the right
hand, and a fewe miles below goeth into Tame, <i>ripâ
dextrâ</i>. * * * * The beauty of Bermigham, a good
markett towne in the extreame parts of Warwike-shire, is
one street going up alonge, almost from the left ripe of the
brooke up a meane hill by the length of a quarter of a
mile. I saw but one Paroch Church in the towne. There
be many smiths in the towne that use to make knives
and all mannour of cuttinge tooles, and many loriners
that make bittes, and a great many naylors. Soe that a
great part of the towne is maintained by smithes whoe
have their iron and sea-cole out of Stafford-shire.”</p>

<p>This description of the town is minute and careful.
The “mansion house of tymber” still remains as the Old
Crown House in Deritend; and nearly opposite other
half-timbered houses of the same period survive. The
“propper chappell” has greatly changed its form, and the
descriptions of trade are no longer strictly accurate, as
some of the handicrafts are now better known at Sheffield,
Walsall, and Halesowen. Some other old houses of the
sixteenth century still remain, one notably in Digbeth,
which has been carefully preserved; and one early sixteenth
century house in Bull Street, near Dale End, has just
been removed (1886). One remarkable change has
occurred since Leland’s days; for the streams which
crossed the roads have disappeared beneath, and the
pumps and wells and water courses are long since gone.</p>

<p><b>Camden’s Description, 1584.</b>&mdash;The visit of William
Camden confirms Leland’s account, and shows considerable
progress, as the town was “swarming with inhabitants
and echoing with the noise of anvils,” and the general
prosperity evidently continued through the century, and
far into the next century too, for it is clear that the
manufacture of swords, if not of guns and pistols, had
begun and was destined to extend the fame and improve
the industrial condition of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Prince Rupert.</b>&mdash;The busy occupants of the line of
road traversed by Leland and Camden had serious trouble a
century later. Charles I. on his way, in 1642, to Edge
Hill had stopped at Aston Hall, which had been built
early in the seventeenth century, and was believed to be
from a design by Inigo Jones. Sir Thomas Holte had
been true to the King, but had become unpopular with the
Birmingham people, who were on the Parliamentary side.
Aston Hall was attacked and besieged for three days, and
the traces of the cannonading still remain. In the April
of the next year, 1643, the fiery Rupert advanced to
Birmingham from Camp Hill, and was stopped in Deritend
by the barricades and valour of the people, but he forced
his way, plundered and fired eighty houses, and left
the town on the other side after heavy losses of life and
limb. Clarendon has described Birmingham “as of
great fame for hearty wilful affected disloyalty to the King
as any town in England,” and the town had supplied the
Parliamentary army with 15,000 swords, but “Prince
Rupert’s Burning Cruelty to Birmingham” only intensified
the opposition to the King and his cause.</p>

<p><b>A City of Refuge.</b>&mdash;The latter part of the seventeenth
century saw many marked advances in the prosperity of
the town. The extravagances of the restoration period
greatly increased the demand for many of the products of
Birmingham ingenuity and skill. The demand for fire-arms
also encouraged and extended one of the trades which was
afterwards to become one of the great industries of the
town; not only so, but Birmingham had become a sort
of City of Refuge for reformers of all sorts, and a sort of
Free Port for many sorts of manufactures which, owing to
the customs of corporate towns, were restricted elsewhere.
The “five mile,” and other acts, drove out many useful
and able people and sent them to reside in a place where
there was more elbow room and more free air, and thus
not only the population but the energy and usefulness of
the inhabitants rapidly increased. The visits of George Fox
had stimulated many people, like those of Wesley a century
later, and every influence, industrial, political, religious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
social, seemed to continue and develop and intensify the
life and progress of the town.</p>

<p><b>Early Printers and Booksellers</b>&mdash;The eighteenth
century added but little to the antiquities, but
much to the history of Birmingham. The industrial
developments which Leland and Camden noted made
far more rapid progress towards the end of the seventeenth
century, when Birmingham became as famous
for fire-arms as it had been for pikes and swords half
a century before. Even that progress was, however,
to be far exceeded before the eighteenth century
ended, and the almost infinite variety of manufactures
had become established. Birmingham was, in fact, in
those times, what London has since become, the centre
towards which the foremost men of the day tended
for many years. In the early years of the century,
Dr. Johnson’s father came to Birmingham weekly with a
small stock of books&mdash;the only supply the town seems to
have had&mdash;but a few years later Thomas Warren had
begun to print, newspapers were started, and books of
considerable importance were published. Dr. Johnson’s
first literary work, his translation of Lobo’s Abyssinia, was
dictated to Warren, but probably not printed in Birmingham,
although as early as 1712, and possibly ten years
sooner, books were printed in the town. So early as
1652 a master of the Grammar School had published a
Latin Grammar&mdash;the earliest Birmingham book&mdash;and in
1717 the first book printed in Birmingham appeared from
Matthew Unwin’s press.</p>

<p><b>Early Maps and Engravings</b>&mdash;Thomas Warren’s
first known book is dated 1728, and many important
works afterwards came from his press. Engraving, as
well as printing, soon became common, and many
excellent examples soon came forth. In 1731, William
Westley published the first map or Plan of Birmingham,
followed by others of great value, as Bradford’s,
in 1751, and Hanson’s, in 1779; and Bradford also
issued a “View of Birmingham,” of a size and quality
unsurpassed in line-engraving, of which only two copies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
have survived. Many folio and quarto volumes
appeared in the middle of the century from Thomas
Aris, C. Earl, and others, and were remarkably fine
productions for a midland town a century and a half
ago.</p>

<p><b>John Baskerville</b>&mdash;All these, however, were surpassed
by the far-famed productions of John Baskerville’s press,
for his experience as a grave-stone cutter in Moor Street,
and his fine taste and restless energy enabled him to produce
type and paper, and to print in so excellent a style,
that his productions soon won European fame. At Easy
Hill&mdash;the house, in ruins, still remains&mdash;he made his own
presses, type, and probably paper to some extent, and
spent hundreds of pounds before he had formed letters to
please his fastidious eyes and excellent taste. Birmingham
has few greater claims to honour in the industries and arts
than those which have so universally been given to the
Baskerville Press.</p>

<p><b>Directories</b>&mdash;The later half of the century was even
more distinguished in many other ways. The modern
Directories were not popular or common till late in the
last century. Even the rare London Directory of 1677
does not seem to have had many imitators, but about
1750 the increasing number of trades stimulated the
demand. In Newcastle-on-Tyne, and in Sheffield and
other towns, Directories appeared, and Birmingham was
among the first, and one of great interest and value
appeared in 1770, and probably earlier, followed by others,
ever increasing as the population increased, but very
curiously contrasting with the huge volumes of later days.</p>

<p><b>Cotton Spinning</b>&mdash;One of the most remarkable,
perhaps, of the industrial schemes in Birmingham, was the
establishment of a cotton mill, which still remains as a
building and shows its origin, although now a rolling mill.
It was the natural result of the genius of John Wyatt and
of Lewis Paul, for in a room in the Upper Priory&mdash;now
covered by the schools of the Society of Friends&mdash;the first
cotton spinning machine was erected and worked, and the
old distaff and spindle, and spinning machine doomed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Thomas Warren, Edward Cave, Dr. James, and others,
took up the speculation of Lewis Paul, and mills were
built at Birmingham and Northampton, but before the
century closed they had failed to pay.</p>

<p><b>The Soho Works</b>&mdash;The most famous of all the classes
of industrial enterprises in Birmingham was the famous
“Soho.” From the manufacture of “toys”&mdash;steel toys,
buckles, buttons, sword-hilts, &amp;c.&mdash;in Snow Hill, Matthew
Boulton had removed to Soho in 1763. There he erected
machinery for water power, but by happy accident, James
Watt visited the place, and Boulton was so struck with his
improvements in the steam engine, which Soho only
seemed able to produce, that a connection began which
has immortalised the names of Boulton and Watt, and
shed undying glory on the industrial history of Birmingham.
The story has been too often told to require
repetition, but even now it has scarcely been fully told.
Soho itself has perished, scarcely a relic remains, but
James Watt’s house at Heathfield still exists with relics
which will ever be an honour to his genius, and will keep
his memory green. All admirers of the genius of Watt
will hope and desire that these remains of an industrial
hero, a genius of the useful arts, may become a public
trust, to show posterity how so illustrious a man of science
was valued in his life, and is honoured by those who
rejoice in the fruits of his genius and skill.</p>

<p><b>Famous Men: the Soho Circle</b>&mdash;One of the
most remarkable chapters in the history of Birmingham
would be a full record of the men of the latter half, or
even the last quarter, of the last century who gave lustre
to the town, and who materially helped its constant
progress. “Soho” had not only supplied what the world
had long wanted, “power,” but it had set up a standard of
excellence, and had trained a class of workmen who were to
go forth to conquer, at home and abroad, in all industrial
work. The spirit of Soho is still abroad in the land, and
Birmingham may claim to have been one of the foremost
in the mechanical progress of the past hundred years.</p>

<p>The galaxy of great men, as it has been called, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
met in Birmingham a century ago is certainly remarkable.
Boulton was a native of the town, but many “strangers
came within the gates.” James Watt&mdash;almost all-accomplished&mdash;was
soon followed by Joseph Priestley,
who lived here for eleven years. His fame had preceded
him, his great discoveries had been made. A storm of
popular and ignorant bigotry drove him from the town,
wrecked his home, ruined his laboratory, and burned his
library; but the sons have “blushed to find their fathers
were his foes;” and a statue honoured his memory and his
great discovery of oxygen on the centenary of that day.
Dr. Darwin, of Lichfield and Derby, the father of a noble
line, and himself a man of genius and power, was a
constant visitor. William Murdock, one of the ablest of
the Soho group, the first maker of a locomotive, and the
practical inventor of gas-lighting, was long a resident in
the town, and is buried near Boulton and Watt. John
Baskerville, the printer; Josiah Wedgwood, the famous
art-potter; James Keir, the great chemist; Richard Edgeworth
and Thomas Day, authors; Joseph Berington,
the learned Roman Catholic; Dr. Withering, the botanist;
Dr. Parr, the famous Greek scholar; Samuel Galton, the
Quaker; John Proud, the Swedenborgian; John Wyatt,
the inventor; Edmund Hector, Johnson’s friend; and
many others, formed such a “happy family” of genius
and worth as few towns of the period could surpass or
equal; and that “golden age” of Birmingham, the men
and names, and works and progress of the last century,
must ever be remembered and honoured, even in these
days of quicker progress and greater victories in scientific
and industrial pursuits.</p>

LOCAL GOVERNING BODIES.</h3>

<p class="author">BY J. THACKRAY BUNCE.</p>

<p>The Local Government of Birmingham is administered
by five sets of authorities:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Justices of the Peace.</p>

<p>2. Town Council.</p>

<p>3. Drainage Board.</p>

<p>4. Boards of Guardians.</p>

<p>5. School Board.</p>

<p><b>Justices of the Peace.</b>&mdash;The first of these bodies
was constituted by Royal Grant in 1838, when the town
was incorporated as a municipal borough. A Court of
Quarter Sessions was then next established, for the trial
of prisoners, and a Recorder was appointed. The Court of
Petty Sessions for the borough was instituted at the
same time, under special commission of the peace. The
duties of the justices are to maintain peace and order in
the borough, to administer justice at petty sessions, to
appoint visitors to the prison, and to grant licences for
public houses, theatres, and concert halls, and licences for
music and dancing in houses kept for the sale of liquor.
They are invested with powers of control over the police
on occasions of actual or threatened disturbance of
public order; and any two of them, sitting in petty
sessions, are empowered to suspend or dismiss any police
constable for sufficient cause.</p>

<p><b>The Town Council</b> has charge of the general
administration of the affairs of the borough; watching;
lighting; making, draining, and repairing streets and
roads; the care of the public health, by the prevention
and removal of nuisances, the enforcement of a system
of house inspection, the collection and disposal of night
soil and house refuse, and the maintenance of a Borough
Hospital; the control of the Borough Cemetery, (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which it acts as a Burial Board;) the provision and
management of Baths and Parks; of Free Libraries,
Museums, and Schools of Art; and it also has control
of the manufacture and sale of Gas, and the provision of
Water. The powers of the Corporation, originally and
to a limited extent conferred by Royal Charter in 1838,
were by degrees enlarged by twenty special local Acts or
Orders sanctioned by Parliament, for various purposes.
The whole of these were, in 1883, consolidated in the
Birmingham Corporation Consolidation Act, which,
together with the Municipal Corporations Amendment
Act of 1882, and the Public Health Act of 1875,
constitute the Municipal Law under which the affairs
of the Borough are administered.</p>

<p><b>The Drainage Board</b> is a body composed in part
of representatives elected by the Town Council, and in
part of representatives elected by the Local Boards of
districts adjoining the Borough. There are twenty-two
members of this Board, two of them, the Mayor of
Birmingham, and the Chairman of the Aston Manor
Local Board being ex-officio, and the others being
elected in the following proportions: Birmingham Town
Council eleven; one each from the Local Boards of
Aston Manor, Balsall Heath, Handsworth, Harborne,
Saltley, and Smethwick; and one each (elected by
the respective Boards of Guardians) for Aston Rural
District and Sutton Coldfield, King’s Norton and
Northfield, and Perry Barr. The Board has charge of the
sewage from the districts above named, extending over an
area of 45,000 acres. The whole of the sewers are
made to converge to a common outlet at Saltley, where
the sewage is received into tanks, and is then purified,
first by precipitation, and next by passing it through
the land of the sewage farm, the effluent water, thus
rendered clear and harmless, being poured into the
rivers Cole and Tame. The sludge remaining in the
sewage tanks is dug into the land. For the purposes
of sewage treatment the Drainage Board has acquired about
1,200 acres of land in the Tame Valley. The Board has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
borrowing powers, exercised to the extent of £400,000
for the acquisition of land and the execution of works;
and it has also rating powers for the payment of interest
and repayment of capital, and for current expenditure.
These powers are exercised by serving precepts upon
the several local authorities included in the Drainage area,
in proportion to the number of their rated tenements.</p>

<p><b>The Boards of Guardians</b> have charge of the poor
law administration of the Borough. There are three
parishes in the Borough, namely, Birmingham, Edgbaston,
and part of Aston. The parish of Birmingham is separately
administered by a Board of Guardians, originally constituted
under a Local Act of 23 Geo. III. (1782) modified
by a local Act of 1 and 2 Wm. IV. (1831) and further
modified by “orders” of the Poor Law Board, and the
Local Government Board; the last of these was issued in
1882. The number of Guardians for the parish is 60, and
the twelve overseers (the rating authority for poor law
purposes) also have seats on the Board.</p>

<p>The parish of Edgbaston is wholly in the Borough,
but it forms part of the King’s Norton Union, and as to
the poor law is governed by the Guardians of that Union.
The parish of Aston is only partially within the Borough;
it is administered by the Guardians of Aston Union.
Edgbaston and Aston parochial affairs are governed under
the general poor law Acts, there being no local Act for
either parish.</p>

<p><b>The School Board</b>, which consists of fifteen members,
was first elected in November, 1870, under the Elementary
Education Act passed in that year. It has charge of the
Board Schools throughout the Borough.</p>

<p>The above described bodies are all of them representative,
but are elected on different franchises, and by
different methods.</p>

<p>The Town Council is elected by the votes of all
occupiers in the sixteen wards in which the Borough is
divided, women householders being entitled to vote;
three Councillors being chosen for each ward, and one of
the three retiring each year; and the votes being given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
by ballot. The Drainage Board is elected by the governing
authorities. The Guardians of the Poor are chosen, in
Birmingham; by ratepayers of £12 annual value, the
whole Board being elected at one time, by voting papers
delivered at the place of election; and in the other parishes
by all occupying householders, by voting papers collected
from the electors. The School Board is elected by the
votes of all householders, the whole Board retiring at the
end of three years, and the votes being taken on the
cumulative plan, each elector giving the whole of his votes
to one candidate, or dividing them in any other proportion,
at pleasure.</p>

<p>Each of the bodies is invested with borrowing and
rating powers, limited by local or general acts. The
Town Council levies rates on the whole Borough&mdash;a
Municipal or Borough Rate for general municipal
purposes, under the Municipal Corporations Acts, and an
Improvement Rate, for purposes specified in the Local
Improvement Act. The Drainage Board and the School
Board serve precepts upon the Town Council for the amounts
they respectively require, and these amounts are included
in the Borough Rate. The Guardians of the Poor
make rates for their respective parishes for poor law
purposes; and they collect, on behalf of the Town
Council, the rates levied for municipal expenditure,
including the money required by the Drainage Board and
the School Board. There is one assessment for local
rates, made (under a recent agreement with the Town
Council) by the parish overseers.</p>

<p>The preceding statement shortly describes the existing
arrangement of local government in Birmingham; but, in
order to explain the growth of the system now in operation,
it is necessary briefly to sketch the history of local
administration. Birmingham has always been what is
called a free town, that is, until after the passing of the
Municipal Corporations Act in 1835, it had no Corporation,
with a restricted burgess roll, and consequently
the community was open to all who cared to settle in the
town for the purposes of residence or trade, a circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which largely contributed to the rapid growth of Birmingham
in population, industry, and wealth. Down to the
year 1769, the government of the place was controlled by
the three sets of authorities existing in all non-chartered
communities.&mdash;1, the justices, to keep the peace, and to
punish crime. 2, the court leet (with its elected jury, its
high and low bailiffs, its ale tasters, flesh connors, and
leather sealers) meeting at irregular intervals, under the
direction of the Lord of the Manor, and invested with the
care of markets, nuisances, and other matters pertaining
to, or interfering with, the rights of the lord. 3, the
Churchwardens, who transacted the church and parish
business, and held vestry meetings for general town
purposes, and for the choice of surveyors of the highways.</p>

<p>In 1769, an Act of Parliament was obtained, constituting
a body of Commissioners for the purposes of maintaining,
improving, and lighting the town, and invested with
general powers affecting the health and safety of the
inhabitants, and the common welfare. By subsequent
Acts&mdash;five in number, the last of these being passed in
1828&mdash;the powers of the Street Commissioners were extended,
and they were authorised by the last named Act
to build a Town Hall. Their authority was confined to
what was then known as “the town of Birmingham,” the
boundaries of which were co-extensive with the parish of
Birmingham. The first Commissioners were named in
the Act constituting them, and vacancies were thereafter
filled up by the Commissioners themselves, without
reference to the inhabitants. The system of local
government thus instituted continued unchanged until the
year 1838. In 1832, Birmingham was, for the first time,
under the provisions of the Reform Act, constituted a
Parliamentary borough, with the right of returning two
members to the House of Commons. The boundaries of
the Borough were so arranged as to include the parish of
Birmingham, the parish of Edgbaston, and the hamlets of
Deritend and Bordesley, and Duddeston and Nechells, in
the parish of Aston, the area thus formed being 8,240 acres.
The Parliamentary Reform Act was followed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
passing of the Municipal Corporations Act, in 1835. For a
considerable time there had been a strong feeling in
favour of some completer form of local government than
that afforded by the Commissioners Acts, and especially
for government founded upon the representative principle.
In 1837, steps were taken to obtain a charter of incorporation
for the town, under the authority of the Municipal
Corporations Act; and in October, 1838, after much
opposition, both locally and in Parliament, a charter was
granted, and the Corporation of Birmingham came into
existence.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the new Municipal Borough were
fixed so as to correspond with those of the Parliamentary
Borough, above described. The area was divided into
thirteen wards (extended in 1873 to sixteen wards), and
the Council was constituted of 16 aldermen and 48
councillors. The first elections of councillors took place
on the 26th of December, 1838, and on the day
following the Council met, and elected the aldermen,
the governing body being then fully constituted. Mr.
William Scholefield was elected the first Mayor.</p>

<p>Although Birmingham had now obtained a system of
representative government, the state of affairs was by no
means satisfactory. In the parish of Birmingham the
self-elected Commissioners of the Street Act retained their
full authority, and in the district of Deritend and Bordesley
local government was for certain purposes still
exercised by a body of Commissioners constituted by an Act
passed in 1791, while Duddeston and Nechells were
governed by Commissioners appointed under an Act of
1829. There were consequently four governing bodies
within the borough, and the powers of the new Corporation
were consequently seriously limited and its action impeded.
Other difficulties of a peculiarly embarrassing character
speedily developed themselves. The validity of the
Charter was contested both in the Law Courts and in
Parliament; disputes arose between the Borough Magistracy
and the County Bench; hindrances were put in the
way of the Court of Quarter Sessions granted for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Borough. In addition to these causes of disquiet the
occurrence of the Chartist riots of 1839 furnished a
pretext for withdrawing from the Corporation the right of
establishing a constabulary or police force for the town,
and a special Police Act was passed by which, while paid
for by the ratepayers, the police force was placed under
the absolute control of a Government Commissioner. In
1842 this perplexing condition of affairs was, however,
brought to an end, by the passing of an Act of Parliament
confirming the Charters of Birmingham and Manchester,
and an Act was also passed transferring to the Corporation
of Birmingham the control of the local police force.
The powers of the Town Council, however, were still very
limited, owing to the conflicting local authorities existing
in the Borough, and it became evident in the course of
time that, in the public interests, the representative body
must finally be made supreme. The minor bodies did
not yield without a contest, but in the end the pressure
of opinion overcame their resistance, and in 1851 the
passing of the Birmingham Improvement Act put an end
to all the bodies of Commissioners, and transferred their
powers, with others provided by the Act, to the Town
Council, as the representative of the ratepayers of the
borough, and the Town Council became thenceforward
the sole governing authority for all municipal purposes.
The Act mentioned further authorised the borrowing of
loans for purposes of town improvements and for a system of
sewerage, and empowered the Council to levy a special rate
for such purposes, in addition to the ordinary municipal rate
levied under the Municipal Corporations Act. Ten years
later, in 1861, a second Improvement Act invested the
Corporation with further powers of administration and of
borrowing; and numerous other Acts were subsequently
obtained for specific purposes. Among these were the
Parks Act, 1854; an order (1873) extending to sixteen the
number of Wards in the Borough;&mdash;an Act giving the
Council power to acquire closed burial grounds and to
lay them out as places of public recreation, passed in
1878; Acts for the purchase of the Gas and Water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
undertakings in 1875; an Act for a Sanitary Improvement
Scheme under the provisions of the Artisans’
Dwellings Act, 1876; for the constitution of a Drainage
Board, in 1878; and for the issue of Corporation Stock
in 1880. The powers of most of these enactments, with
additional powers, were embodied in the Birmingham
Corporation Consolidation Act of 1883, which, amongst
other provisions, abolished the restriction to one penny
in the pound previously imposed upon the Free Libraries
Rate (under the General Libraries Act) and authorised
the Council to conduct a Municipal School of Art.</p>

<p>The Consolidation Act, therefore, now constitutes the
authority under which (in addition to the powers conferred
by general municipal law) the government of the borough
is now administered. The following statement, extracted
from the “History of the Corporation of Birmingham,”
explains the scope and working of the system:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The municipal government, under the Charter of
Incorporation and the Acts of Parliament relating to
municipal corporations, is conducted by a council, consisting
of forty-eight councillors and sixteen aldermen.</p>

<p>“Three councillors are allotted to and elected by each
of the sixteen wards into which the borough is divided,
and each councillor is elected for three years, the elections
being so arranged that one-third of the councillors (one
in each ward) retire every year, and elections for the
choice of their successors are held on the first of
November. The aldermen are chosen by the members
of the Council, and are elected for six years; they may
be chosen from amongst the members of the Council, or
from fit persons not members of the Council, but who are
qualified for election to it. The Mayor is chosen by the
Council, on the ninth of November, for a term of one
year. Under the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, it
was obligatory that, at the time of being elected, he should
be a member of the Council; but by the Municipal
Corporations Act of 1882 it is provided (sec. 15) that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
‘the Mayor shall be a fit person elected by the Council
from among the aldermen or councillors, or persons
qualified to be such.’ There is now no property qualification
required for any members of the Council.</p>

<p>“The Council, as a whole, is the rating and controlling
authority for the Borough. In all matters subjected to its
authority it acts upon communications from the Mayor,
upon motions made upon its own initiative (regulated
by its standing orders for the conduct of business) and
upon reports and proposals from the Committees it
appoints, and to which it delegates specified branches of
municipal work, under such regulations and with such
limitations as it may direct.</p>

<p>“These Committees have varied from time to time;
at present they are sixteen in number, and are
named, constituted, and empowered as follows, taking
them in the order in which they are stated in the
‘Borough of Birmingham Municipal Diary,’ issued by
the Town Clerk, under the direction of the Council:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="Chapter_II_II" id="Chapter_II_II"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span><br />
EDUCATION.</h3>

<p class="author">BY OSMUND AIRY, M.A.,<br />
H.M. INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS FOR BIRMINGHAM.</p>

<p>It can fairly be said that there is probably no town in
England which possesses a more complete educational
system than Birmingham. This system has been no effect
of a pre-conceived design, but has grown up, piece by piece,
in the stress of the life of a great manufacturing centre,
where people of leisure may be counted on the fingers of
one hand. All the more, probably, it has been constantly
and definitely adapting itself to the needs of the locality.
The boast is at any rate a just one, that in this busy
population the road is clear, clear that is of all artificial
obstructions, clearer far than in many a more polished and
cultivated society, for a boy to rise from the gutter to the
University, or to eminence in any science or art.</p>

<p><b>Foundation of the Grammar School.</b>&mdash;King
Edward’s School owes its origin to an institution more
than a century and a half older than itself. The Gild of
the Holy Cross, the earliest record of which is to be found
in a writ of Richard II., July 10, 1392, was a body which
concerned itself, not of course with education, but with
functions partly religious and partly quasi-municipal. It
possessed a Gild Hall, a building of wood and plaster,
standing at a distance from the town on the south side of
the highway to Hales Owen, now New Street. In 1547
its possessions were seized by the King, and they continued
in the Crown until 1552, when Edward VI., upon
the petition of the inhabitants, gave them back to the
town for the maintenance of a Free Grammar School, for
the instruction of children in grammar. The clear yearly
value of these lands was then £21,<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
assigned to William Symmons, gent., Richard Smallbrook,
Bailiff, and 18 other inhabitants, “to hold by fealty only,
in free soccage” on condition of an annual payment at
Michaelmas of £1 (apparently commuted in 1810 for
£25. 15s. 6d.). These twenty assignees were to hold
their position for life, and all vacancies by death or
removal were to be filled up by co-optation. In the first
instance they were to be inhabitants of the manor of
Birmingham, but the restriction was modified in 1830.
They were to nominate a Pedagogue and a Sub-pedagogue,
to whose support the revenues were to be exclusively
employed; and they were permitted to acquire further
revenues to an amount not exceeding £20 per annum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Statutes.</span>&mdash;More than one hundred years later,
Oct. 20, 1676, the Governors issued their first statutes.
No tenant of school property might be a Governor.
The house, then occupied by the chief schoolmaster, with
a barn and croft in New Street,<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a close called the Lower
Leasowe or Broom close, in the “foreign” of Birmingham,
and the pit on the lower side of the Leasowe, were
appropriated to the use of himself and his successors for
ever; while the usher’s house, with the garden, use of the
pump, and other appurtenances, a barn and croft in New
Street, and Kimberley’s croft in Moor Street, were
similarly appropriated to the usher. The salaries of the
chief master and usher were to be £68. 15s. 0d. and
£34. 6s. 8d. respectively. There were appointed also
a chief master’s assistant; an English master, to teach in
a distinct school fifty boys<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to read English; and a
scrivener, to teach twenty boys to write and cast accounts.
The first two were to be unmarried, but the Governor reserved
the power of allowing the scrivener to marry. £30 per
annum was allowed for repairs to the school and masters’
houses, payment of dues, etc. Another statute permitted
the Governors, when their funds allowed, “to set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to Poore Tradesmen, when they come out of their
apprenticeship, or others who want stock to manage their
trade, £10 a piece, <i>gratis</i>, for 6 months, on good
security;” but no record exists of this having been acted
upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scholarships.</span>&mdash;£70 a year was devoted to forming
seven scholarships of £10 a year each, tenable at any
college in either University.<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Children from the manor
had the preference; then those from adjacent places, who
had spent the last three years in the school; failing such,
the poorest and most capable, to be selected from the
upper form by an independent body.<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>At the end of the reign of Charles II., the charter was
surrendered to the Crown, probably under a writ of
“Quo warranto;” a new one dated February 20, 1685,
being granted by James II. Six years later, a decree in
chancery was obtained annulling the new charter, and
restoring the old one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Building.</span>&mdash;In 1707, the old Gild Hall
was removed, and a new building erected, consisting of a
centre and two wings, the latter coming close up to the
street, enclosing three sides of a small quadrangle, comprising
a dwelling house for the head master, one large
and two small school rooms, and a library. A separate
house for the second master stood behind. A large tower
in the centre was “ornamented with a sleepy figure of the
donor, Edward VI., dressed in a royal mantle, with the
ensigns of the garter, holding a Bible and a sceptre.” In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
1756, a set of urns was placed on the parapet, to relieve
the stiff air of the building.<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Establishment of Branch Schools.</span>&mdash;In 1751, a
step of far-reaching importance to the town was taken.
The Governors ordained that (having regard to “the great
numbers of children who, by reason of their poverty or
the negligence of their parents, were never taught to read
the English tongue, and the advantages from having many
such children taught to read English, more than could be
taught in the School”) four masters or mistresses<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> should
be chosen to teach English to not more than forty boys or
girls apiece in various parts of the town, with a salary of
£15, or less in proportion to the numbers. In October,
1790, we read that the Governors “have very laudably
opened an evening school in their rooms in Shutt Lane”
(used as a <i>branch</i> school previous to 1788), “for the
instruction of forty boys in writing and accounts; another
school is also opened in Mr. Peele’s in Great Charles
Street for twenty boys.”<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corruption in the Management.</span>&mdash;Up to 1824,
however, the school was far from doing its duty. The
revenues disappeared in mysterious ways. The Head
Master, Mr. Cooke, gave leases as he thought proper,
both as to terms and duration. No money was granted
for scholarships. The parents paid the most exorbitant
terms for books and stationery. “Altogether the school
was a nest of peculation, and greediness became so
paramount that the statue of the Royal Founder was
allowed to decay and to tumble from its time-honoured
elevation into the quadrangle in front of the school.” In
1824, an intrigue between the Governors, the Masters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the Bishop of Lichfield (whose consent was necessary
to all changes), to move the school from the town, and
make it select, was frustrated by the vigorous action of the
inhabitants, and a commission was appointed by the
Court of Chancery to carry out a thorough investigation
into the conduct of the school. In 1825 the Master was
ordered to draw up a scheme for its future establishment,
and to report whether it should be rebuilt; and in 1828
it was further referred to him to enquire whether the old
site or a new one should be chosen, and how the money
required should be raised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bill of 1830-1.</span>&mdash;In May, 1830, after a prolonged
struggle of the Governors and Master against the people,
a bill was presented to parliament to enable the Governors
to build a new school, to raise £50,000 for the purpose,
and to regulate the school according to a scheme approved
by Chancery. It was vehemently opposed by the Dissenters,
on the clause directing that “no person shall be elected a
governor who is not a member of the Established Church
of England,” and was thrown out on the third reading
in the Lords, but passed in the following year, the
obnoxious clauses having been removed. In the first
place, the school was to be rebuilt on the old site, at a
cost of £30,000, and all branches of an English education,
in addition to the dead languages, were to be taught. No
boy was to be admitted under eight years of age, or
retained after nineteen (no limits of age had existed
hitherto); and boys, not sons of inhabitants, were to pay
fees. In the second place, a new school was to be built
distinct from the Grammar School, for the teaching of
modern languages; while four branch schools for the free
education of boys and girls of the humbler classes were
to be erected before 1840, £1,000 being spent upon each.
Ten exhibitions, each of £50 per annum, were created,
Birmingham boys taking precedence. Ratepayers, though
non-resident, might be governors, provided they were not
tenants of school property, and attended once in two
years. The accounts were to be published yearly, and
there was also to be an annual examination of the school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Present Building.</span>&mdash;The new building was
erected from the designs of Mr. Charles Barry, the
architect of the Houses of Parliament. The style is the
latest pure Gothic in England, that which prevailed
immediately before the commencement of the 16th
century. “The school is entered by a spacious porch,
highly ornamented: two large apartments, with oak
pannelled walls and ceilings, are the school room for the
commercial school;<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the classical school is 120 feet long,
45 high, 30 wide, with a lofty angular roof, supported by
a series of magnificent obtuse angled arches of the Tudor
style. At the end, where the chair of the Head Master
is placed, is a handsome lofty oak carved screen. The
Second Master’s chair is opposite to this, and the Usher’s
chairs are on the sides. There is a library and a fine bust
of Edward VI. by Scheemaker.”</p>

<p>It was not until 1836 that the Governors were able to
carry out actively the provisions of the Act of 1831. A
fresh Act in 1837 amended the former one by repealing
the power to build a separate modern school, which it was
now arranged should be carried on in the premises of the
Grammar School. The new building had cost £67,000,
instead of £30,000; and the excess was to be defrayed
out of the £50,000 mentioned in the Act of 1831. By
the scheme approved in Chancery, in 1838, masters were
ordered to be appointed during that year in elementary
literature, geography, elements of composition, sacred and
profane history, mathematics, natural philosophy, writing,
and arithmetic; French and German masters in 1839 and
1840; and Spanish and Italian when advisable. Temporary
lecturers might also be employed, and a visitation of
the school was to take place once a year. A branch
school was in progress in Aston Street, in 1837, and a
second was proposed in Cottage Lane, near the Sandpits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Mr. E. Oxenbould and Miss A. Corbett were elected
master and mistress of two others in the Parade, in
August, 1838; and a fourth for boys, was opened in
Meriden Street, on April 10, 1839. These branch
schools, the history of which it is difficult to make out
clearly, were for the time regulated by the statute of 1852,
which established four schools, Gem Street, Edward
Street, Meriden Street, and Bath Row, accommodating
altogether 510 boys, from 8 to 14 years of age, and 490
girls from 7 to 13. The children were nominated by the
Governors, and examined for admission by the Head
Master, who had entire control of these schools, visited
them once a month, and made an annual report on their
condition to the Governors. A general English and
religious education was given; the boys learning in
addition bookkeeping and the elements of geometry, and
the girls, knitting and plain needlework.</p>

<p>In 1861 it was ordered that the second master should
have the general supervision of the English school, under
the direction of the head master, who retained in his
hands the admission and promotion of scholars, and most
other matters of importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Discontent in the Town.</span>&mdash;Meanwhile serious discontent
had arisen with the constitution of the body
of governors. By the original charter it was laid down
that they should be “twenty of the more discreet inhabitants.”
But, by the operation of the method of
co-optation in filling up vacancies, the following state of
things, as given by Mr. T. H. Green, one of the assistant
commissioners of 1864, had arisen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> “The Board has
fairly represented the upper or more select section of
society in Birmingham, so far as this section is politically
conservative and attached to the established Church.
It has been necessarily antagonistic to the Town Council,
and careless or contemptuous of local politics. To belong
to it has been a certain social distinction. Social and
municipal distinction have not coincided, and hence the
Board has been an object of public animosity, irrespectively
of the manner in which it has exercised its
functions.”<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And this it still more strongly put in the
report of the Commission. “No dissenter, within the
memory of man, has been a governor; till recently no one
of liberal politics has been a governor; no mayor of the
town has till the present year been a governor; no
member of the borough except one, a conservative; not
one Town Councillor.”</p>

<p>Abortive attempts were made in 1831, 1842, and 1861,
to introduce the Town Council element; and in 1864,
after much newspaper agitation, signalised especially by
the letters of “Historicus,”<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a grammar school Reform
Association was formed, which, in 1865, in conjunction
with the Town Council, endeavoured in vain to induce
the Governors to surrender the principle of co-optation.
Both appealed to the Endowed Schools Commissioners,
who proposed that there should be 21 governors, of whom
10 should be chosen by the Town Council, and the rest
by co-optation; and that for the future free education
should be given only to those who had passed a competitive
examination. In 1868, however, the Town Council
resolved to demand that all the governors should be
elected from their body, a demand they repeated in 1872
(in answer to a slight modification by the Commissioners
of the above scheme). They also objected to the proposed
entrance and tuition fees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The New Scheme.</span>&mdash;Finally, in 1875, the Charity
Commissioners proposed the scheme in a great measure
now in force.<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> There were to be 21 governors, of whom
eight were to be nominated by the Town Council, and four
by Oxford, Cambridge, and London Universities, and the
Teachers on the foundation; the remainder by the
governors themselves. Those nominated by the Town
Council were to serve for six years, those by the Universities
and Teachers for seven: all were to be eligible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
reappointment. Boys were to enter the school by competitive
examination in two classes, (1) free foundation scholars;
(2) those paying entrance and tuition fees.<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This
scheme was vehemently but unsuccessfully contested by
the Town Council. All efforts to move the Charity
Commissioners were unavailing. When at length it
reached the Commons, on March 5th, 1878, Mr. Bright,
supported by the other Borough members, Mr. Chamberlain,
and Mr. Muntz, moved its rejection; but the motion
was defeated by a majority of 59, in a house of 199, and
the scheme received the royal assent on March 16th.</p>

<p>Immediately previous to 1878, the schools on the
foundation were (1) The Grammar School (Classical,
English, and Lower) with 584 boys: (2) the Branch
Elementary Schools with 607 boys and 554 girls.<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> A
great development was now arranged for. There were
now to be (1) a High School for Boys up to the age of
19, with preparation for the Universities; (2) a Middle
School for Boys to age of 16, when Latin, at least one
modern language, natural science, and drawing, were to
be taught. (3) An Upper School for Girls. (4) The
existing branch Elementary Schools, or “Lower Middle”
School for children to age of 14, teaching all subjects
included in the possible curriculum of the best public
Elementary Schools<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> though reaching a far higher
standard than is there obtained. The necessity for the
head and second masters being in Orders was done away
with; the religious teaching was to be undoctrinal, and
there was to be an emphatic conscience clause: no master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
might hold any benefice or cure of souls, nor might he in
future,<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> without the express permission of the Governors,
take boarders. The jurisdiction of the Master of the
Middle School was increased, though supreme authority
in matters of discipline was still reserved to the Head
Master. Provision was made for the subdivision of the
Middle School and the Upper Girls’ School, when desirable,
and for the establishment of evening schools.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scholarships</span> were arranged as follows:&mdash;(1) Foundation
Scholarships in all the Schools, the holders of
which received education free. The number of these was
not to exceed a third of the total number in each school.
Half of those given in the Lower Middle Schools were
restricted to scholars attending Public Elementary Schools
within the Borough, for not less than two consecutive
years immediately preceding admission, and a third of the
remainder were offered for competition among the candidates
for admission; the rest being competed for by
scholars already in the School. (2) King Edward VI.
Scholarships, viz.: annual payments to deserving scholars
while at the school, to an amount not less than £200 a
year; the value of each to be not more than £25 a year
<i>plus</i> tuition fees. (3) Besides the James Charities exhibitions
of £50 a year at Oxford or Cambridge, £400 a
year was to be given for exhibitions at either of the
Universities, to scholars of at least two years standing in
the High School; and £200 for exhibitions tenable at
any educational institution for boys or girls at either
High or Middle School. All these scholarships were to
be gained by competition.<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In the competitive examination for entrance, preference
was to be given to boys and girls resident within ten miles
of Birmingham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Development of 1883.</span>&mdash;In 1883, the final step in
development was taken. It was felt that the “Lower
Middle” Schools, were now doing work which largely
overlapped that of the Middle School, and the consent of
the Charity Commissioners was obtained to the following
change. These Schools were converted into Schools of
the same grade as the “Middle” School of the 1878
scheme, (1) The Girls’ School at Meriden street had
been transferred to Camp hill, in 1881, and a Boys’
School was now erected on the same site. (2) The
Proprietary School at the Five Ways was absorbed into
the foundation, and the staff of the old Middle School,
hitherto domiciled at New Street, was transferred to improved
buildings there, the boys from the Bath Row
School also being taken in. The <i>pupils</i> from the old
Middle School were dispersed throughout the various
Boys’ Schools now opened. (3) This enabled the provision
of 1878 for a High School for Girls to be carried out<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in
the New Street Buildings thus left vacant. (4) A new
school for Boys and Girls was erected in Albert Road,
Aston, to which the scholars from Gem Street were
transferred. In 1882, the Boys Schools at Edward Street,
Meriden Street, and Bath Row were closed. Thus, at the
present time, the Schools under the foundation are&mdash;High
Schools for Boys and Girls at New Street; Grammar
Schools for Boys at the Five Ways, Boys and Girls
at Aston and Camp Hill, Girls at Summer Hill and
Bath Row. The admission fee is at the High School,
10/-, and at the Grammar Schools, 2/6; the annual
tuition fee at the High Schools, £9; at the Grammar
Schools, £3.</p>

<p>Among the numerous honours gained at the Universities
since 1800 should be mentioned the following:&mdash;at
<i>Cambridge</i>, 8 chancellor’s medallists, and 10 university
scholars; 6 senior classics, 28 first class-men in the classical
tripos, and 6 first class-men in the moral science tripos; 35
wranglers: at <i>Oxford</i>, 8 university scholars, 5 first class-men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<i>in Literis Humanioribus</i>, 11 in classical moderations, and 2
<i>in Disciplinis Mathematicis et Physicis</i>. The present
Archbishop of Canterbury, one Bishop (Lightfoot), and
one Regius Professor of Divinity (Westcott), are also old
Birmingham boys. During the past few years the school
has also gained high and numerous distinctions at
London University, Queen’s College (Birmingham), and
the Mason Science College.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">List of the Head Masters</span> from the earliest date
now known:&mdash;<i>circa</i> 1650, John Barton; 1654, Nathaniel
Brooksby; 1685, John Hickes, M.A.; 1694, James
Parkinson; 1722, John Hansted; 1726, Edward Mainwaring;
1746, John Wilkinson; 1759, Thomas Green;
1766, John Brailsford; 1775, Thomas Price; 1797, John
Cooke; 1830, Francis Jeune (afterwards Dean of Jersey,
Master of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Bishop of Peterborough);
1838, James Prince Lee (afterwards Bishop of
Manchester); 1848, Edwin Hamilton Gifford, Archdeacon
of London; 1862, Charles Evans; 1872, A. R. Vardy.
It should also be mentioned that in 1830, the second
master was the Rev. Rann Kennedy, father of the
celebrated Head Master of Shrewsbury, himself a classic
of the highest attainments.</p>

<p><b>Queen’s College.</b>&mdash;The story of Queen’s College is
an interesting record of mingled success and failure; of
success where it set about doing much needed work, and of
failure where it appeared to be placing itself in antagonism
to the prevailing spirit and influences of the town.</p>

<p>The formation of a School of Medicine and Surgery
for Birmingham and the Midland Counties was suggested
in 1828 by Mr. Sands Cox, who had made a diligent
inspection of all the chief medical schools at home and
abroad; and it was immediately carried out by the help
of Dr. Johnstone and the unstinted liberality of Dr.
Warneford. Lectureships in various branches of Medicine
were at once established, and in 1830 a Museum and
Library were fitted up. From 1836 to 1843 the new
Institution was known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> “The Birmingham Royal
School of Medicine and Surgery,” the royal patronage
having been obtained in the former year. But in 1843 a
Royal Charter of Incorporation was granted to it under the
title of “The Queen’s College, at Birmingham.” By the
munificent endowments of Dr. Warneford,<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the Governors
were soon enabled to widen the scope of the college.
Departments were created for literature, science, and art,
and for instruction in the doctrines and duties of Christianity
according to the Church of England. Queen’s
Hospital was founded with a chaplaincy, also endowed
with £1,000 by Dr. Warneford, who, in addition, appears
to have borne almost the whole expense of the College
Chapel. An arrangement was now made whereby the
London University admitted students of the college for the
degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Medicine, and, upon the
college Certificate, for B.A., M.A., B.C.L., and D.C.L. The
exclusively Church of England character of the college
and all concerned with it was untiringly insisted upon by
its promoters. A chapel was established with daily
services at which the attendance was compulsory. By the
supplemental charter of 1847 it was laid down that the
Lord Bishop of the Diocese was to be the visitor; the
Principal, who was to be a Nobleman, or one of the Hon.
Governors, must also belong to the Church of England.
The Vice-President must be a dignitary of the Church
near Birmingham: all the classical, mathematical, and
medical tutors must also be churchmen. The feelings
which prompted these rigorous regulations are concisely
expressed in a letter of Dr. Warneford to Mr. Sands Cox
in 1849, in which he says, “to guard against the subtle
designs of the Jesuits, and the insidious intrusion of
malignant dissenters, imperatively requires much deliberation!”
From a second supplemental charter of 1851, it
appears that Dr. Warneford had given £4,400, increased
in 1852 by £6,500, for a Professorship of Pastoral Theology;
and £3,500, increased in 1852 by £2,500, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Wardenship, the holder of which must necessarily be a
clergyman. All resident students were to be members of the
Church, and attendance at Chapel service was compulsory.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the attempt to erect an
exclusively Church of England College in a town in which
dissent was overwhelmingly predominant was a leading
cause of the failure which awaited the institution.</p>

<p>The affairs of the college were by the original charter to
be conducted by a council of eighteen, of whom twelve were
to be elected by the first body of Governors, and two were
to be Professors elected from their own body; the Principal,
Vice-Principal, Treasurer, and Dean of the Faculty completed
the number. Vacancies in the council were to be
filled up by co-optation, and vacancies in the Professorial
staff by the council from a list supplied by the Professors.
By the supplemental charter of 1847, the Principal and
Council were constituted one body politic and corporate,
and were allowed to acquire property of an annual value
not exceeding £2,500, and the same amount for the
hospital. The council was also greatly widened by twelve
<i>ex-officio</i> Governors, of whom two were members of the
council of the hospital, which was represented also by the
senior Physician and senior Surgeon; the others were the
Lord-Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Warwickshire, the
Dean of Worcester, Archdeacon of Coventry, the Mayor
of the borough, the High Bailiff of the Manor, and the
Rectors of St. Martin’s and St. Philip’s.</p>

<p>To this body of <i>ex-officio</i> governors was entrusted the
appointment of the Warden, who later became the real
ruler of the college, all matters of general organisation
and discipline, and all religious duties, being in his hands.
The council was further widened by the admission of two
members of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, and
two each from the Birmingham Architectural and Law
Societies. An east wing was added to the college, for
engineering and architecture, containing lecture rooms and
an engineering workshop. A three years’ course and the
passing of two public examinations constituted the
requirements for the degree of C.E. of Queen’s College.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
A Department of General Literature was formed, Dr.
Warneford endowing it in 1852 with £2,000. A full
collegiate system was established for this department,
with resident, and later non-resident students, at which a
three years’ course was to be passed. The subjects of
study were to be Greek, Latin, Mathematics, Logic,
Modern Languages, History, Civil Engineering, Natural,
Political, and Moral Philosophy, and the doctrines of the
Church of England; the subjects selected having
particular reference to the requirements for the examination
of the University of London. A Junior Department
was also established in or about 1851, for a two years’
preparatory course with collegiate discipline. The whole
constitution of the college was, however, codified by the
“Rules and Regulations” of 1857; by which it appears
that these somewhat ambitious views, pointing to the
establishment of a University, had become modified. The
design of the college, as now laid down, was “to provide
instruction for young men intending to engage in one or
other of the following professions:&mdash;(1) Medicine and
Surgery; (2) Civil Architecture and Engineering; (3)
Theology (with a view to ordination); and any other
professional study which may from time to time be
added.<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This instruction is combined with a system of
collegiate training and moral discipline according to the
religious principles of the English schools and colleges
connected with the Church of England, and with so much
of the ordinary branches of a liberal education, in a
department of arts and general literature, as may be
properly given in subordination and in reference to such
special studies.” For the collegiate education the inclusive
fees were to be £75 a year.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that this idea of creating a
resident University in Birmingham was the result of mistaken,
though religious, zeal. For the deep and earnest
feelings which prompted it we must refer to the record of
the meeting of April 20, 1843, contained in Mr. Sands-Co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>x’s
<i>Annals of Queen’s College</i>, published in 1873. But
the conditions of life in the town were not favourable, and
the scheme broke down through its own weight. Resident
students there were, indeed, in small numbers; but the
pecuniary loss which they caused to the college was considerable,
and in 1873 that part of the scheme from which,
thirty years before, so much had been hoped, was declared
not to be “an essential part of the College,” and was allowed
to lapse. Lord Lyttelton, the President, in a letter written
in December, 1873, strongly, though reluctantly, urged
this step. As strongly, too, he urged that the theological
department should be discontinued. “The more simply
and singly the college can henceforth be limited to the
objects of a place of instruction for medical students, the
better and more likely it is to attain those objects. The
hopes that the college might become a University, with
the consequent attempt to engraft upon it Faculties of
Arts, Law, and others, are now, as I fear, mere dreams of
the past.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the work of the college appears for some
years to have been conducted with considerable vigour,
and a certain success. Gradually, however, whether from
bad management, or from the inherent faults of the constitution,
it began to decay, and then its decline was
rapid. In 1863, an appeal was put out to relieve it from
a debt of nearly £4,000; and in 1864, its condition fell
under the eyes of the Charity Commissioners. As the
result of their enquiry “it appeared in effect that the
college had fallen into a state of decay, and was on the
verge of bankruptcy; that the buildings were suffering
from want of funds for repairs, and the students diminishing,
and that the college could not be made effective and
answer the purpose for which it was founded, without the
interference of the Court of Chancery, and that the
present constitution of the said college was defective.”
Accordingly, in February, 1867, a scheme was ordered to
be drawn up for the future management, approved by the
Master of the Rolls, May 7, 1867, and confirmed by
“The Queen’s College, Birmingham, Act.” The council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was henceforth to consist of the President, Vice-President,
Warden, and twelve others. No condition of churchmanship
was attached to the last named. All vacancies were
to be filled up, no longer by co-optation, but by the annual
meetings. Officers of the college might serve on the
Council, but no one who was concerned in the profits of
any work done or materials provided for the college. The
three original departments, theology, medicine, and arts,<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
were maintained, the Warden to be the resident head of
all three. Architecture and engineering were dropped out.
Until the debt was cleared off, the offices of Warden and
Professor of Theology were to be held by the same
person, afterwards by different persons, the Professor to
be appointed by the President, Vice-President, and
Visitor. There were to be also Professors of Classics and
Mathematics and a Medical Tutor. The rights of the
church were further secured by a clause referring all
questions touching her doctrine and discipline to the
President and Vice-President, and in the last resort
to the Visitor, whose decision was to be final. With the
obvious exceptions, however, of the Warden and Theology
Professor, all religious tests on the members of the staff
were abolished. Methods were laid down for the payment
of the existing debt. A clause, specially declaring that the
natural history and anatomy museum were to be preserved
in the college, along with the models of machinery and
philosophical apparatus, and were to be open to properly
qualified persons free of charge, was violated in 1870 by
their being removed to Aston Hall, the rooms thus set
free being given up to the School of Art. Finally, the
college and hospital were entirely separated, the latter
being compelled to repay Warneford’s endowment of
£1,000.</p>

<p>During 1873 and 1874, evening classes in connection
with the Arts Department were started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> “to afford to
young men who have had a good education, and who
desire to maintain and improve their acquirements, an
opportunity of doing this at a small expense.” Morning
Classes for ladies in connection with the Birmingham
Higher Education Association were also attempted. The
Arts Department of the College itself appears to have
died a natural death in 1872: in 1871 it contained “three
or four students preparing for admission into the Theological
or Medical Departments.”</p>

<p>The Theological Department also has led a languishing
existence. In 1874 it contained but 11 students<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and
from then until 1882 the number fluctuated between 11
and 23. Since then it has again been declining. The
report of 1885 laments this fact, but gives no figures.
An attempt has been made in this year to raise the
standard of this department by appointing the Cambridge
Preliminary Examination as the final examination of
the College.</p>

<p>It is by the Medical School, its original <i>raison d’être</i>, that
Queen’s College has a distinct claim upon Birmingham
and the Midlands. This part of the scheme has always
flourished and still is flourishing; and it is justly regarded
as one of the most important provincial schools of medicine
in the kingdom. It started with almost its full development
from the beginning. Thus in 1828 the plan of lectures included
anatomy, physiology, and pathology, materia medica
and medical botany, chemistry, and pharmacy, principles
and practice of physic and surgery, midwifery and other
diseases of women and children. In 1845, we find this
list increased by the division of anatomy into “General
and Surgical,” and “Descriptive and Comparative.”
Chemistry also was added. In 1874, the Chair of
Pathology, which had dropped out of the original list,
was recreated, and an additional Professorship of Physiology
and Anatomy appointed. In 1880, following the
Act for the Registration of Dentists, a School of Dental
Medicine and Surgery was formed, and this was recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in 1882 by the Royal College of Surgeons. The lectures
on anatomy and chemistry were recognised as qualifying
for the degrees of the University of Edinburgh. In 1885,
the Borough Lunatic Asylum was associated with
the College, students being now at liberty to obtain instruction
in lunacy and mental diseases. Summer
dissections were also carried on for the first time in
this year.</p>

<p>In 1882, consequent upon the organisation of the
Mason Science College, an important change was made.
It was felt that if both institutions carried on, within a
stone’s throw of each other, parallel courses of lectures,
great waste of power would ensue. It was therefore
arranged that the lectures on chemistry, botany, and
physiology should in future be delivered by the Professors
of Mason College, acting as lecturers for Queen’s College,
and delivering courses of lectures suited to the requirements
of medical students. In this way not only was the
overlapping avoided, but the endowments of Queen’s
College were materially relieved, while the resources of
the Mason College magnificent library were also available
to the students of the former. The Birmingham Medical
School was now placed in a position of equality with the
richest and best organised Colleges in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that in 1879, in addition to the
already existing Ingleby Scholarships, two new classes of
entrance scholarships were created by the Council, the
Sydenham and Queen’s. The former were to be given by
the vote of the Council to the orphan sons of legally
qualified medical men; the Queen’s were to be awarded
by examination to sons of medical men; the sons of
former students having the preference in both cases.
At the present time the college contains considerably
more than 100 students, that being the normal number.
That its condition, so far as medicine is concerned, is one
of vigorous vitality, may be gathered from the following
extract from the last Report.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> “The students have passed
examinations at five Universities, in six cases gaining
distinction, one being the highest attainable. At the
Primary Examination for the Membership of the Royal
College of Surgeons of England, thirty students passed in
one or both branches. At the above mentioned examinations
there were only four complete rejections during the
year. It must be borne in mind, also, that this result does
not accrue from careful weeding out of students by a test
examination. All students, having attended the required
number of lectures, were permitted to present themselves
for examination.”</p>

<p><b>Mason College.</b>&mdash;The scheme of a University at
Queen’s College had, as we have seen, broken down
through the inherent defects of its design. We come
now to the establishment of another University, which in
its building, equipment, and aims, forms a worthy completion
to the educational system of the town.</p>

<p>Indirectly the result, no doubt, of that movement for
University extension which has characterized the last
twenty years, the establishment of this college was
directly the work of one man, Sir Josiah Mason, whose
fortune had been made during sixty years’ residence in
Birmingham, and who was already a benefactor to the
town through the Orphanage and Almshouses he had
established at Erdington. The considerations which
prompted him to this noble foundation are thus expressed
by himself:&mdash;“When I was a young man&mdash;it is so long
ago that while still living in this generation I can recall
the memories of a time long past&mdash;there were no means
of scientific teaching open to the artisan classes of our
manufacturing towns; and those who, like myself, would
gladly have benefited by them were compelled to plod
their weary way, under disadvantages and through
difficulties of which our young men of this day can form
no adequate idea. Schools at that time were few and
poor, there were no institutions of popular teaching, no
evening classes to which youths might go after their day’s
work was ended.” At eighty years of age, therefore,
he determined to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> “enlarged means of scientific
instruction, on the scale required by the necessities of this
town and district, and upon terms which render it easily
available by persons of all classes, even the very
humblest.” Whatever was necessary for the improvement
of scientific industry, and for the cultivation of art,
especially as applied to manufactures, was to be taught;
facilities were to be afforded, if desirable, for medical
instruction, and, most wisely, the door was left open for
any further development necessary to adapt the scheme to
the requirements of future years.</p>

<p>The plan of the college first began to assume shape
about 1868, under the advice of Mr. G. J. Johnson,
formerly Professor of Law in Queen’s College; Mr.
George Shaw, formerly Professor of Chemistry at Queen’s
College; and Mr. J. Thackray Bunce. It was not,
however, until December 12, 1870, that the Foundation
Deed was executed, by which Dr. Blake and Mr. Johnson
were constituted the first trustees. The Founder had
already purchased some land in Edmund Street, and an
endeavour was made to secure the ground at the corner of
Edmund Street and Congreve Street (upon which the new
Liberal Club now stands); failing that the land stretching
through Edmund Street to Great Charles Street was, after
many difficulties and delays, obtained. The site contains
about an acre.</p>

<p>In September, 1872, the six trustees required by the
foundation deed were thus nominated: Dr. Blake, Messrs.
G. J. Johnson, W. C. Aitken, J. T. Bunce, George Shaw,
and Dr. Heslop; and their first meeting was held on Feb.
23rd, 1873. The architect selected by the founder, Mr. J.
A. Cossins, had meanwhile been visiting the principal
science colleges at home and abroad; and his plans, prepared
from this experience, were approved in the autumn
of 1874. On the founder’s 80th birthday, February 25th,
1875, the first stone was laid by himself, when, in replying
to a congratulatory address, he gave an interesting sketch
of his career from the day when he cobbled shoes in
Kidderminster, to the time when he became the owner
of the largest pen factory in the world. A full description
of the college buildings as completed may be found
in the <i>Birmingham Daily Post</i> for October 2nd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
1880.<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Since that time an important addition has been
made by the erection of a series of rooms for the
Physiological department.</p>

<p>The Foundation Deed lays down this general statement
as to the aims of the proposed college:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It being understood that the institution intended to
be hereby founded is to be called Josiah Mason’s
Scientific College, or Josiah Mason’s College for the study
of Practical Science, he, the said Josiah Mason, hereby
declares that his intention in founding the same is to
promote thorough systematic education and instruction
specially adapted to the practical, mechanical, and artistic
requirements of the manufactures and industrial pursuits
of the midland district, and particularly the boroughs of
Birmingham and Kidderminster, <i>to the exclusion of mere
literary education and instruction, and of all teaching of
theology and of subjects purely theological</i>, which limitations
the said Josiah Mason hereby declares to be fundamental.”</p>

<p>The deed then provides for two courses of instruction,
namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;<i>Regular systematic instruction</i> (to qualify students
either for the B.Sc. and D.Sc. of the University of
London, or for any profession or pursuit in which scientific
knowledge can be usefully applied.)</p>

<p>2.&mdash;<i>Popular instruction</i>, which it is intended shall be
given by evening lectures to artisans and others who cannot
attend the classes for regular systematic instruction.</p>

<p>The regular instruction was to include the following:&mdash;<i>Mathematics</i>,
abstract and applied; <i>Physics</i>, mathematical
and experimental; <i>Chemistry</i>, theoretical, practical, and
applied; <i>The Natural Sciences</i>, especially geology and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
mineralogy, with their application to mines and metallurgy;
<i>Botany</i> and <i>Zoology</i>; <i>Physiology</i>, with reference to the
Laws of Health; <i>English</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>German Languages</i>.
By a subsequent deed of February 23, 1874, Anatomy,
and Greek and Latin languages, were added to the list.
And by a third deed, February 23, 1881, it is provided
that (in order to qualify the College for admission as a
constituent member of the London or Victoria Universities)
regular systematic instruction may at the discretion of the
Trustees include <i>all such other subjects</i> as the Trustees may
for the time being judge necessary or desirable for the
benefit of the students. Similar liberty to vary the course
of instruction, either by the addition of fresh subjects,
or discontinuance of any subject previously taught,
according to the discretion of the Trustees, is given
in the case of the Popular Instruction.</p>

<p>Moreover, once in every fifteen years the provisions of the
deed may be varied, so as better to adapt the regulations to
the circumstances of the time. It is impossible to exaggerate
the importance of this provision, which formed the subject
of the peroration of a beautiful speech by Prof. Max Müller
at the opening ceremony, which ended thus:&mdash;“Let him
rest assured that such faith is never belied, and that rising
and coming generations, while applauding his munificence,
will honour and cherish his memory for nothing so much
as for that one clause in which he seems to say, like a wise
father, ‘Children, I trust you.’” (College Calendar,
1880-81.)</p>

<p>One class of subjects alone is emphatically excluded.
It is “provided always, that no lectures, or teaching, or
examination, shall be permitted in the institution upon
theology, or any question or subject in its nature purely
theological, or upon any question which for the time being
shall be the subject of party political controversy.” And
this condition “the said Josiah Mason doth declare to be
fundamental.” Similarly it is declared to be a fundamental
condition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> “no principal, vice-principal, professor,
teacher, or other officer, servant, or assistant of the
institution shall be required to make any declaration as to,
or to submit to any test whatever of their religious or
theological opinions, or be presumed to be qualified or
disqualified by any such religious or theological opinions,
but shall be appointed solely for their fitness to give the
scientific or artistic instruction required from them.” The
contrast with Queen’s College was complete.</p>

<p>Fees were to be paid by students, the admission of whom
is subject to no limitation whatever in the popular classes.<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
The only limitation as regards the regular classes is that the
Trustees are to give the preference, all other things being
equal, to candidates who have been or are inmates of the
Orphanage, to the extent of not more than one-fifth of
the whole number of regular students, and thereafter to
candidates born within the borough of Birmingham and
Kidderminster, in the proportion of two Birmingham to
one Kidderminster student. The original deed provided
that no student not wholly dependent for a livelihood
upon his own skill or labour, or depending upon the
support of his parents or some other person, should be
admitted to the college; and that students should not be
under fourteen nor above twenty-five years of age. By
the deed of variation, December 12, 1870, the limit of
age was done away with, and the conditions above laid
down were made to apply to the remission of fees. A
preliminary examination for admission is imposed only
upon students under the age of sixteen years.</p>

<p>In every line the deed breathes the spirit of modern
Birmingham; it contains regulations directed to a clear
aim, with absolute freedom to vary those regulations so
as best, at any given time, to secure that aim by recognising
new conditions; it excludes from its scheme no
subject of useful learning; and it maintains the idea that
secular instruction is of too high a dignity to be fettered,
as regards either pupils or instructors, by theological or
political considerations. In one provision not yet noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
it recognises with equal directness, the principle by which
Birmingham has for long been pervaded, viz., that over all
the great institutions of the town, popular control ought to
be exercised. Until the death of the founder, the governing
body was to consist of six trustees; but it was ordered
that after his death the Town Council was to nominate
five others. Vacancies in the Borough Trustees were to
be filled up by the Town Council; those in the other
six by the whole body. One single qualification is laid
down as fundamental for the trusteeship. The holder
must be a Protestant and a layman.</p>

<p>On October 1st, 1880, the College was formally opened,
when a brilliant address was delivered in the Town Hall,
by Professor Huxley, before a meeting attended by
representatives of the Universities, and many leading
scientific bodies, and presided over by the Mayor; and,
in the evening of the same day took place the formal
transfer of the building by the Founder to the Trustees.
“Thus was completed a work which stands without
parallel in the annals of modern education in England,
the gift of a college, amply planned, nobly built, liberally
endowed; the generous benefaction of one man, who
looked for no reward but the consciousness that, by the
foundation, others would have the means of acquiring
knowledge denied by the poverty of his early life to
himself; trusting that though unblessed with children of
his own, he might, in the students of his college, leave
behind him an intelligent, earnest, industrious, and
truth loving and truth seeking progeny for many
generations to come.” During the first year of work, 53
students attended: in 1884-85, 523, of whom 199 were
in the evening classes.</p>

<p>During the session, 1882-3, the college began receiving
a grant from the science and art department, in aid of the
instruction of a limited number of teachers engaged in
science teaching. During the same year, by arrangement
with the School Board, the Council granted six Wright
Memorial Scholarships, to enable scholars from Board
Schools to go through a science course at Mason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
College.<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> These scholarships are tenable for three years,
and relieve the scholars of the payment of all fees.</p>

<p>The Mason College Union, formed with the sanction
of the council, was now opened.<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The circumstances
attending the admission of students from Queen’s College
to certain classes will be found detailed in the section
treating of that institution. The completion of the
scheme necessitated the creation of a new Chair of
Botany. In the early part of the session, the council constituted
the Professors of the College an Academic Board,
to act generally under the superintendence of the council
in regulating and co-ordinating the various departments of
the college; the chairmanship being held by the
Professors in turn. In July, 1883, a department of Coal
Mining and Colliery Management was established, and
upwards of twenty students attended, principally young
mining engineers, preparing for the government examination.
During the year courses of lectures upon education,
provided by Mr. George Dixon, were delivered by
Professor Meiklejohn and Mr. H. Courthope Bowen.
During 1884, the council were enabled to fill up a gap
which they had often deplored by the creation of nine
scholarships, as follows: Two entrance scholarships of
£30 each; one of £30 for students of one year’s
standing; two of £30 each for students of two years’
standing; two of £20 each, connected with the examinations
of the University of London; and two technical
scholarships of £30 each. Each of these is tenable for
one year. In the following year, Messrs. Richard and
George Tangye each created a scholarship of the annual
value of £30. Free popular lectures for artisans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
given throughout the winter, the tickets being distributed
among about one hundred of the leading firms. So much
were they valued, that it was found necessary to repeat
each lecture.</p>

<p>One of the most important and interesting features of
the college is its noble library. With this will always be
connected the name of the late Dr. Heslop, its chief
benefactor, indeed, it may be said, its maker. As early
as 1882, out of its 4,869 volumes, he had contributed
3,130. On the 23rd February, 1886, the library contained
17,554 vols. The geological museum contained at
the same date 19,115 specimens.</p>

<p><b>The Birmingham and Midland Institute</b> is at
present educating more than 4000 persons of both sexes
and of all ranks; and this fact alone is sufficient to show its
importance. The principle upon which it proceeds is one
which at the time of its establishment was entirely novel,
though it has since been adopted in other similar institutions.
It has never professed to lay down <i>a priori</i> a
course of instruction which it considers ought to be given;
but, by supplying a want wherever such want has been
made known, it has endeavoured to adapt itself constantly
to requirements of the people which otherwise would never
be satisfied. In the words of Mr. J. H. Chamberlain,
“We have never made up our minds to teach any
particular subject, unless we were convinced that there
existed outside our walls a present readiness to study it.
But, once convinced of such a desire, we have done whatever
we could to meet it.”</p>

<p>The Institute had its origin, strangely enough, at a time
of marked intellectual decadence in Birmingham. The
existing societies, the Philosophical Institution, the
Mechanics’ Institution, and the Polytechnic Institution,
were dead or moribund. On June 10th, 1852, at the
suggestion of Mr. Arthur Ryland, a few members of the
first-named society met and appointed a committee which
reported in January, 1853. On September 6th the Town
Council gave a grant of the present site, and by an Act
obtained in 1854 the Institute was incorporated. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Act the objects of the Institute are defined to be the
“diffusion and advancement of Science, Literature, and
Art.” There were to be two departments, (a) <i>General</i>,
to provide (1) Reading and News Rooms; (2) Libraries,
Museums, a gallery of the fine arts, collection of mining
records, and other collections for scientific purposes; (3)
Lectures and meetings for discussion in the higher
branches of knowledge, (b) <i>Industrial</i>, to provide (1)
classes for elementary and progressive instruction in
Mathematics and Practical Science, and such other
subjects as may seem fit to the Council of the Institute;
(2) laboratories, models, philosophical apparatus, and all
other things necessary for the objects of the Institute.<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
The Institute was to be governed by a Council of twenty-five
consisting of (1) <i>Official Governors</i>, a President, two
Vice-presidents, and a Treasurer; the head master of
King Edward’s Grammar School, the warden of Queen’s
College, the chairmen of the Committee of the Birmingham
Society of Arts, and of the government School of
ornamental Art. (2) <i>Borough Governors</i>, the Mayor and
four members of the Town Council, elected annually by
that body; and (3) thirteen <i>Elected Governors</i>, viz: eleven
members of the Institute, and two students of the Industrial
Department. The President, the Vice-Presidents,
and the thirteen, were to be chosen by the members of
the Institute at the annual general meeting. Casual
vacancies were to be filled up by the Council, which
was to meet at least once a month. Not less than
three of the thirteen were to be regarded as ineligible for
re-election each year. Among the Presidents will be found
the men most eminent in their various branches of
knowledge.</p>

<p>A start was made in the beginning of 1854, the salary
of a Science teacher for the first year having been
guaranteed by the Science and Art department. Classes
were opened in Chemistry, Physics, and Physiology, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
both sexes, and were carried on in the room of the
Philosophical Institute in Cannon Street, until 1857. On
November 22nd, 1855, £10,000 having previously been
subscribed to the building fund, the first stone of the new
buildings was laid by the Prince Consort. Penny Scientific
lectures were now started; and, in deference to a
most remarkable expression of opinion on the part of the
artisans themselves that they had not education sufficient
to enable them to profit by the lectures as given, Penny
Lectures on elementary Mathematics and Science were
also given. In 1856 Mr. George Dawson and Mr. Sam:
Timmins volunteered to conduct an English Literature
class, which they continued for three years, and classes,
also taught voluntarily, were established in Arithmetic,
Latin, French, English History, Logic, Languages, and
Thought.<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In 1859, a subscription of £5,000 having been raised
to pay off the debt incurred, the Institute now located in
its own buildings, founded a Chemical Society&mdash;at
present the Institute Scientific Society&mdash;members of which
delivered lectures to the men in workshops, as well as
Natural History and Microscopical Societies. In the examination
by the Society of Arts in 1859, one Institute
student, C. J. Woodward, now at the head of the Chemical
department of the Institute, took the first prize in chemistry,
twelve others gaining certificates; while in 1860 both the
English literature prizes were carried off by two other
students, Henry Simpson and Howard S. Pearson, now
Lecturer on English Literature at the Institute. That the
right classes were being touched is shown by the fact that
33 per cent. of the students were artisans, 33 per cent. shopmen
and clerks, and 16 per cent. women of the same ranks.
In 1868 the numbers were 45, 29, and 21 per cent. A
steady increase both of students and subscribers (the latter
induced by the annual conversazione and the high quality
of the occasional lectures) took place during the following
years; and the students were stimulated by the many
valuable prizes offered by leading inhabitants and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Central Literary Association. So crowded had the
classes now become, that it was imperative to secure
further space; and in 1873 the prospect of this was
secured by a re-arrangement of buildings and an exchange
of land with the Free Libraries, £15,000 being subscribed
for the alterations proposed. In the previous year
Charles Kingsley had delivered a famous presidential
address, one result of which was an anonymous gift of
£2,500 to found a class in the Laws of Health. This
class was opened in October, 1873, with 400 students,
and ever since that time has formed an important feature
in the Institute’s programme, branch classes in the subject
being established in 1878 in four of the Board Schools.</p>

<p>At the same date a new departure was made by founding
branch classes at three Board Schools in the outskirts of
the borough. Of the success of the Industrial Department
up to this time we cannot do better than quote from
an article by Mr. Edwin Smith, for many years secretary
to the Institute, in the <i>Central Literary Magazine</i> for
April, 1874:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>“It has enabled a pupil teacher from a national school
to win a Whitworth scholarship against competitors from
the universities and from the principal science colleges in
the kingdom; a working rule maker to win a scholarship
at one of the Royal Colleges of Science, and a working
electro-plater to win the first prizes from the Society of
Arts in four modern languages; it has sent out distinguished
pupils to take part in the civil service of India, to conduct
mining operations in America, to take part in the telegraphic
service of Australia, to fill an important commercial post
in Japan, to conduct the laboratory work in some of
the largest manufactories in the country, to become head
masters and assistant masters in our Grammar Schools, to
help in the science teaching of the University of Cambridge,
and to fill responsible posts on newspapers of the provincial
press; twelve of its own teachers have been educated in
its classes, and it has sent into the manufactories and workshops
of the town, men who have applied to numerous
useful purposes in their trade the knowledge which they
have acquired within the walls of the Institute.”</p></div>

<p>During 1878 was begun the erection of the new buildings
from the designs of Mr. J. H. Chamberlain, at an
estimated cost of £30,000. The great fire of January 11th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
1879, which utterly destroyed the Free Libraries, greatly
interfered with the work, and it was not until the summer
of 1881, that the beautiful buildings fronting to Paradise
Street, were ready for occupation. The burden of the
heavy debt incurred was somewhat lightened by the
prospects of a bequest, subject to two lives, of £50,000.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the annual examination of the classes which
did not fall under the Science and Art Departments had
been conducted by volunteers. An endeavour was made
in 1880 to induce the Senate of the London University to
undertake this work. The Senate did not see its way to
do this, but it suggested that the council should apply to
the Rev. Philip Magnus, one of the University Examiners,
and later a member of the Commission on Technical
Education. Mr. Magnus undertook the duty, and the
plan has been retained since then, the standard for the
council certificate being made as nearly as possible that
of the matriculation examinations at London. In this
year was founded the Institute Union of Teachers and
Students, and it was now, too, that the Institute gave birth
to a number of local institutes, environing the town in a
continuous chain, formed on the lines of the parent
body, and serving local requirements.<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> During 1882,
a musical section was begun, with 157 members, and
an instrumental class with 500. A still more noteworthy
movement was the establishment of a class in
practical metallurgy. During the following year this had
developed into an excellent laboratory, furnaces, balance
room, fume chambers, and benches for twenty-three students;
the class being under the care of Mr. A. H. Hiorns.
A new class was also formed in iron and steel, in connection
with the City and Guilds of London Institute. The council
co-operated, too, in organizing a course of lectures on
Health by eminent medical men in the town, similar to
those delivered in Edinburgh and elsewhere, and these
have since been an annual institution. During this
fruitful year were founded the Institute Magazine, and
the Debating, Dramatic, and Literary Sections. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Archæological Section, still in full vitality, had been
organized as early as 1870, and continues to issue quarto
volumes of Transactions, containing the Papers read, with
original illustrations and records of excursions to local
and other places of archæological interests.</p>

<p>Fruitful, however, though this year of 1883 was, it
stands out as one peculiarly sad in the Institute history, for
during it took place the sudden death of Mr. John Henry
Chamberlain, who as Hon. Secretary since 1865, had
continuously devoted himself to its interest. In the words
of the Report for 1883, “Under his guidance the Institute
had undergone development which is truly marvellous …
he had genius to see the needs of the time, and the
direction in which the Institute could be developed to
meet them.… The wisdom of his counsel, the extent
and variety of his knowledge, the grace of his eloquence,
and the wonderful charm of his personal presence, made
him a colleague whom it is impossible to replace. He
expired almost in the act of serving the Institute.”</p>

<p>During 1884, a meteorological observatory was formed
at the Monument, in Monument Road, an anemometer
being erected there at the cost of Mr. Follett Osler, and the
Birmingham Chess Club became a new section of the
Institute. In 1885, the School of Art was removed from the
Institute Buildings, where it had hitherto found a home, to
the beautiful building in Edmund Street erected by the
town for its reception. This gave great additional space,
sorely needed, for the industrial department, and, on the
initiative of Mr. G. H. Kenrick, it was at once utilised,
at a cost of £2,000 (guaranteed by Mr. Kenrick) for a
great expansion of the metallurgical classes. An engineering
workshop was formed, and the laboratory greatly increased,
so that the Institute now possesses&mdash;and it is perhaps its
most interesting feature&mdash;the most extensive metallurgical
school in Great Britain, one indeed well-nigh worthy of the
position of Birmingham in the manufacturing world. In
this year too, classes in singing and in the practice of several
musical instruments were formed, the violin class being
particularly successful. And a teachers’ board was
established, from which valuable suggestions are offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to the council for improvements in the education given
to the classes.</p>

<p>The following figures are worth recording. In 1854,
there were <i>one</i> member<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and 165 students; in 1874,
1591 members, and 2179 students; in 1886, 1927
members, and (in the central and branch classes) 4190
students, thus distributed: science, 1474; language and
literature, 1046; arithmetic, 324; matriculation, 13;
music, 1233; ladies 100.</p>

<p><b>Elementary Education.</b>&mdash;The work performed by
the School Board may be best realized from the following
figures. Previous to the passing of the Elementary
Education Act, 1870, there were within the Borough
public elementary schools with accommodation for 28,983
children, and shortly afterwards further accommodation
was made for 1,476; so that in round numbers there
were places for about 30,000 children. There were also
the so called elementary schools on the King Edward VI.’s
foundation, noticed under that head, and a few private
adventure schools. The official enquiry of 1871 showed,
however, that accommodation was then necessary for
55,000, so that even then the town was scarcely more
than half supplied. But, further, this half supply was but
half utilized, since the average attendance in the schools
was only about 16,000.</p>

<p>During the fifteen years of its existence the School
Board has provided thirty-two large sets of new buildings,
most of them with extensive playgrounds, and it also
occupies three sets of school premises which are rented.
The total accommodation provided in these schools is
sufficient for 35,277 children; while that in the Denominational
Schools is now about the same as in 1871, the
total being 29,141. A few certified efficient schools
accommodate 794 children; so that there is at the present
date a total accommodation of 65,212, or more than
double that of 1871. Still more remarkable is the change
wrought in the average attendance. In 1871 this was
50.3 per cent. of the number on the books. In other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
words, out of every 100 places provided 50 were vacant.
The average attendance is now 85 per cent.</p>

<p>Even now the accommodation provided does not reach
that required. The population being 420,000 there
should be places for one-sixth of that number, according
to the government scale, that is for 70,000. Thus the
Board is still behind-hand to the amount of 5,000 places.
Moreover, according to the average of the last eight years,
the population of the Borough is increasing at the rate of
60,000 per annum, and consequently the accommodation
required at the rate of 1,000 per annum. In other words,
the Board has to provide five new schools to catch up
the present deficit, and one school every year to keep
pace with the yearly increase.</p>

<p>Besides the schools whose curriculum is confined
to the subjects named in the New Code, the Board has
established, upon the initiative and in a great measure at
the cost of the Chairman, George Dixon, Esq., M.P., a
Technical School for boys in the 7th standard, which
provides an education in elementary science, machine
construction, &amp;c.; and which is furnished with a large
chemical laboratory, and an admirably fitted lecture room,
a special room for teaching technical drawing, and a
workshop in which the boys are trained to the use of
tools and to working from scale. This school, which is
well worth a visit, is in Bridge Street, five minutes’ walk
from the Town Hall, in premises handed over to the
Board, rent free, and partially fitted up by Mr. Dixon.</p>

<p>Many of the Board Schools form real architectural ornaments
of the town. They are in three stages of design, the
earliest being that in which boys, girls, and infants form
separate departments, the boys and the infants being
usually on the ground floor, the girls on the floor above
the boys. In the second stage a large centre hall is
surrounded by class-rooms on the ground floor; half way
to the roof runs a gallery, from which doors open into
another set of class-rooms. The infants are on the
ground floor (except in Hope Street), in a separate part
of the building; the whole school being under the
supervision of a master. In the last stage everything is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
on the ground floor. The latest erected buildings of this
stage are models of airiness and light. The specimens of
the three styles easiest reached and most worth seeing are
respectively Bristol Street, Icknield Street, and Stratford
Road or Foundry Road.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that half-time scholars are now
almost unknown, although the conditions of life would
seem to point to a wide extension of the system.</p>

<p>A few scholarships, far fewer than could be wished, are
at the disposal of the Board. They are of three classes,
Major, Elementary Science, and Minor. Boys who hold
the Wright, Piddock, and J. H. Chamberlain Memorial
Scholarships receive £15 a year, on certain conditions,
during a two years’ course at King Edward’s School, and
£25 a year, with remittance of fees, for three years more
at Mason College. Several Elementary Science Scholarships,
in connection with the Science and Art Department,
have hitherto been provided out of a fund called the
Higher Education Fund, raised for the purpose of assisting
poor but deserving scholars, by which a grant of £5 is
guaranteed, with an additional £5 on passing a good
examination under the Science and Art Department. It is
greatly to be regretted that the funds raised for providing
Minor Scholarships are all exhausted, except the Chamberlain
and Edgbaston Day School for Girls Trust Funds.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the Board’s work, when a Church
majority was elected, religious education was given in the
Birmingham schools. Upon the accession of the Liberal
and Non-Conformist party to power such education was
entirely done away with. The result of frequent and
somewhat bitter controversy has been that at present a
small portion of the Bible is read each day by the head
teacher without note or comment.</p>

<p>The Voluntary Schools have, up till quite recently, had
no common organization. There has now, however, been
formed an Association of Voluntary School Managers,
under whose auspices it is proposed to undertake some
amount of inspection, and which will frame and discuss
all measures directed to their common welfare. The
Chairman is the Rev. Canon Bowlby, Rector of St. Philip’s.</p>

<p><b>Municipal School of Art.</b>&mdash;[By Mr. <span class="smcap">E. R. Taylor</span>,
Head Master.]&mdash;The Society of Arts and School of Art
were, in June, 1885, transferred to the Corporation under
the above title. This Society was established at a
meeting held in the Public Office, Moor Street, on 7th
February, 1821, at which it was resolved:&mdash;(1.) “That
an Institution be now established in Birmingham for the
encouragement of arts and manufactures, and that it be
called ‘The Birmingham Society of Arts.’” (2.) “That a
Museum be formed for the reception of the most
approved specimens of sculpture, and of all such other
works illustrative of the different branches of Art as the
Society may have the means of procuring.” (3.) “That
suitable accommodation be provided for students.” A
subscription list was forthwith opened, and Sir Robert
Lawley, Bart., gave in addition a valuable collection of
casts from the antique. The Museum thus formed was
opened for members and students in May, 1822, and in
1827 the first annual exhibition of pictures was held. In
1829 the Society erected the galleries in New Street, now
occupied by the Royal Society of Artists, and in this year
the first conversazione of the Society of Arts took place.
Until 1842 the Society was managed by a joint committee,
composed of lay and professional members with equal
powers. The lay committee, representing the subscribers,
were desirous of furthering the original intention of
providing means for art education by applying for aid
from the Government School of Design, newly formed in
London. Hitherto the teaching had been carried on by
the members of the professional, or artists’ committee,
who acted as visitors to the School for Drawing from the
Antique. The school was open on two evenings in each
week, but the average nightly attendance was only
fourteen.</p>

<p>The professional committee demurred against these proposed
changes, and, on their being adopted by the subscribers,
withdrew from the Society, and afterwards formed
the present Royal Society of Artists. In 1843, Mr. Dobson,
who is now an Associate of the Royal Academy, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the first Head Master, and the title of the Society was at
this time altered to “The Society of Arts and School of
Design.”</p>

<p>In 1845, Mr. Heavyside succeeded Mr. Dobson, but
held the office for a year only, being in turn succeeded by
Mr. Thos. Clarke. The number of students at this time
was 448.</p>

<p>Mr. George Wallis became Head Master in 1851, and
introduced many changes in the organization and work of
the school. He resigned in 1857, Mr. D. Raimbach
being his successor.</p>

<p>By an agreement between the Society of Artists and the
Council of the newly founded Birmingham and Midland
Institute, the latter undertook to provide double the
existing accommodation for the Society of Arts in their
proposed building; and the school was transferred in the
summer of 1858 to the rooms which it continued to
occupy until last year.</p>

<p>The record of the school from the first seems to be one
of continuously increasing success; for in 1864 the
number of students had more than doubled, being 939,
including elementary and advanced classes.</p>

<p>In its early days the school was much indebted to the
Rev. James Prince Lee, M.A., who held the post of
Chairman until he was removed to the See of Manchester,
and in more recent times to the late Mr. John Henry
Chamberlain, Chairman, and Mr. Edwin Smith, Secretary.</p>

<p>In 1875 the whole of the elementary teaching in the
evening was transferred to branch classes held in Board
Schools.</p>

<p>A most generous offer was made to the school in 1876.
An anonymous donor placed the sum of £10,000 at the
disposal of the Committee, with a request that it should
be chiefly, if not altogether, employed in the improvement
of the teaching department, and in the foundation of
scholarships or exhibitions.</p>

<p>On the resignation of Mr. Raimbach, the present Head
Master (Mr. Edward R. Taylor) was appointed in May, 1877.
In the year 1880 a scheme was initiated by a donation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
£5,000 from Messrs. Richard and George Tangye, which
has resulted in the present Museum and Art Gallery, with
its noble collection of pictures and objects of industrial
art, the gifts of wealthy citizens to the town. The increasing
difficulties under which the School of Art laboured
in providing room for the education by which alone these
art treasures could be made of use to the town were not
lost sight of, and in 1881 the Mayor (Mr. Richard
Chamberlain, M.P.) was enabled to announce to the
Corporation that land would be given by Mr. Cregoe
Colmore, in the centre of the town, on which to build a
School of Art, and that Miss Ryland would give £10,000,
and Messrs. Richard and George Tangye would also give
£10,000 towards the cost of building a School on condition
that the Town Council would undertake its management.
The result of this generosity is the beautiful building in
Margaret Street, the last work of the late Mr. J. H.
Chamberlain, who had for many years acted as Chairman
of the School, and had taken the deepest interest in its
success. It may fairly claim to be one of the best schools
of art ever erected. The lighting is bright and cheerful,
furnishing in this a contrast to most of such institutions;
and the accommodation, especially for the modelling classes
and those for studies bearing on design, is most ample,
and a great improvement on that given in the old premises.</p>

<p>In the Central and Branch Schools there are this
Session 733 students, and in the seven Branch Schools
706 students, mostly artisans. The following are some

LIBRARIES: PAST AND PRESENT.</h3>

<p class="author">BY J. D. MULLINS.</p>

<p><b>The first Public Library, 1733</b>, was one which still
exists, and was founded by the Rev. W. Higgs, first Rector
of St. Philip’s, who left his Library and a sum of money
for a Parochial Library “free to all Clergymen of the
Church of England in the town and neighbourhood of
Birmingham, and of all other students who shall be
recommended either by the Rector of St. Philip’s, or the
Rector of St. Martin’s, in Birmingham, or the Rector of
Sheldon, near Birmingham,” and which was “designed
for the encouragement and promotion of useful Literature,
more especially of theological learning.” The books were
to be lent out at the discretion of the Trustees to suitable
persons, and a folio was to be kept six weeks, a quarto
one month, and an octavo or duodecimo fourteen days.
The Endowment was £200 in 3 per cents., and it was
announced that donations would be very acceptable “for the
increase of the Library,” as no payment was required for
admission to the use of it. The Library was long kept in
a room adjoining St. Philip’s Rectory, (and is duly provided
for in the New Rectory) and deserves this mention as the
first Free Library in our town.</p>

<p><b>Subscription Libraries.</b>&mdash;Subscription Libraries
had been established by William Hutton in Bull Street
(in 1751), Joseph Crompton in Colmore Row, and others
in the latter half of the last century, but the most
important was that of John Lowe, at the Stamp Office in
Cherry Street, which was established in 1776, and the
catalogue of which in 1796 included 103 pages; and
more than 10,000 Standard Books, to which the price of
each was added in case of a purchase. The annual
subscriptions were 16/- or a guinea according to the
privileges, and not only were quarterly subscribers taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
but non-subscribers could have books to read on depositing
their value, at twopence per volume per week; or if over
four shillings in value at threepence per volume per week.
And the Library was to be open from eight o’clock in the
morning till nine o’clock in the evening. It is to the
credit of the readers of a century ago that a large number
of French books were provided for their use.</p>

<p>In 1787 a Subscription Library was opened at 13
Suffolk Street, by M. and S. Olds. The subscription was
12/- per year, 7/- the half year, and 4/- the quarter.</p>

<p><b>The Birmingham (Old) Library</b> was founded
about November, 1779, (though the exact place of its
origination is not known), by nineteen subscribers, nearly
all being Dissenters, in fact, only one being a member
of the Established Church. The proposal was made to
the laity generally, and to some of the Clergy, several of
whom became members when the Library had become a
success. It was founded on broad principles to supply
the numerous readers with books, which few private
persons could afford to buy, and it was based on
principles so sound that it has been highly successful, and
has been one of the most prosperous and long-lived of all
provincial Libraries. At first, its progress seems to have
been slow, and its history obscure; but on the arrival of
Dr. Priestley in Birmingham, in 1780, its real prosperity
commenced. His experience of a similar Library at
Leeds, and his characteristic energy and enthusiasm were
given to the young Institution. He not only wrote the
various advertisements which appeared, but he drew up
a code of laws on the principle adopted at Leeds, and the
best testimony to their merit is that they have been substantially
without important changes for 100 years.</p>

<p>The books were to be bought by a Committee of twenty
chosen annually. The Laws could be made or repealed
only at an Annual Meeting or by special notice. Books
were to be proposed by the Subscribers, and selected by
the Committee. The plan proved highly successful, and
the Subscribers rapidly increased. The entrance fee was
One Guinea, and the Subscription Six Shillings a year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
raised to Eight Shillings in 1781. The Librarian was paid
£10 a year, attendance 2 to 5 p.m.</p>

<p>During the first two years the Library had its home at
the house of Mr. John Lee, junr., 115, Snow Hill, but
was afterwards removed to Messrs. Pearson and Rollason’s,
Swan Yard, High Street. By January, 1782, a Library
Room was taken, and the books removed there, “hours
2 to 5,” within those hours any Subscriber might see the
books, read and make extracts, etc., at his pleasure; in
1785, eleven to one was added to the hours.</p>

<p>In 1790, May 5th, the Library was re-opened at the
Upper Priory (late Mr. Payton’s Repository)<a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> with 4,000
volumes. About this time a plan was started to build a
Library on a Tontine System of 181 shares, “near to a
street called Cherry Street, and then lately used as a
Bowling Green, formerly called Corbett’s Bowling Green.”
An extension doubling the area of the Library Buildings
was made about 1843.</p>

<p>At its Centenary, 1879, this Library contained 50,000
volumes. It has now (1886) 1,591 proprietors and subscribers;
an annual income of £1,680; an expenditure
of £1,531; and 984 volumes were added to the Library
in 1885. The Librarian is Mr. C. E. Scarse.</p>

<p><b>Birmingham New Library.</b>&mdash;In 1794 the New
Library was founded by some who were dissatisfied with
the management of the Parent Institution. The Laws
of the Old Library were adopted, with two exceptions.
It was originally started in Cannon Street. Rooms were
then built on the Tontine plan, in Temple Row West,
where the Joint Stock Bank now stands, and after a more
or less successful career the New Library was amalgamated
with the Union Street or Old Birmingham Library in
1860.</p>

<p><b>The Medical Library and Institute.</b>&mdash;This
Library was formed in 1790 at a meeting at the Union
Tavern in Cherry Street, and remained for many years as
part of the Old Birmingham Library, accessible to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
ordinary subscribers, but on the formation of the Medical
Institute, in 1878, the books were given up to the promoters
of the Institute. It is now a library of some
11,500 vols. at the new building in Edmund Street. Mr.
T. G. Johnson is the Librarian. The Institute is supported
by the chief medical men of the town and neighbourhood.</p>

<p><b>The Birmingham Law Library</b> was founded in
1831, by the Barristers and Attorneys practising in
Birmingham and the neighbourhood. This is supported
by annual subscriptions. It contains nearly 6,000 volumes
of Law Works, Reports, Acts, etc. It is in Wellington
Passage, Bennett’s Hill. An admirable Catalogue of this
Library has been compiled by Mr. Thomas Horton.</p>

<p><b>The Mason College</b> in Edmund Street, opened in
1880, has now a very choice Scientific Library. It is
especially rich in English and Foreign Serials, Transactions,
Journals, Magazines, Reviews, Reports, etc., of which
Mr. S. Allport the Librarian published a Catalogue in
1883. It owes much of its high character to the late
Dr. Heslop, who took great interest in its formation and
gave three-fourths of the books.</p>

<p><b>Other Libraries.</b>&mdash;Among the Libraries of the past
should be recorded: (1) The Mechanics’ Institution
founded in 1826, and carried on till 1842. It had a
Reference and Circulating Library with a Reading Room
for the use of the members. (2) The Artisans’ Library,
founded in 1831, open three evenings a week. Of
smaller Libraries, the Parochial one of St. Martin’s,
founded by the Rector (Dr. Miller) in 1850, was far
above the average character of such Institutions; it was
located in Inge Street, and was much used.</p>

<p><b>News Rooms</b>, either with Libraries or alone, were
not numerous in the early part of this century. In August,
1808, the first subscription News Room appears to have
been opened at Messrs. Thomson and Wrightson’s Stamp
Office, New Street, open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Four London Daily Papers, Lloyd’s List, Prices Current,
one Sunday, three Provincial, and three Birmingham
Papers, with Reviews and Magazines were provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A Commercial News Room</b> was established in
1823, by a number of gentlemen, who took Shares of
£20 each to erect a Building and carry on the work.</p>

<p><b>A News Room</b> of large size and importance was
built in 1825, in Waterloo Street, corner of Bennett’s
Hill, where the old County Court stood, and where the
Inland Revenue Office now stands. As this contained all
the leading London Periodicals and Foreign Newspapers,
Shipping, Commercial and Law Intelligence, files of
important Papers, London Gazette, Times and local
Journals, it may almost be included among our Libraries.</p>

<p>As a contrast with this, the only News Room of that
time, there are now <i>Nine</i>, in addition to the Reference
Reading Room, viz.:&mdash;<i>Three Subscription</i>, the Old
Library, the Midland Institute, and the Exchange respectively,
and six <i>free News Rooms</i>, viz., the Central News
Room, and five Branches in different parts of the town.</p>

<p><b>The Free Libraries of Birmingham.</b>&mdash;These
were originated, and are sustained, by the municipality, at
the cost of the ratepayers, by the levying of a rate of a
little over one penny in the pound on the rents or rateable
value of the Borough. This rate produces £9,500 a year
and maintains the principal or Central Libraries, which
include Reference Department of 80,000 volumes, Central
Lending Library of 25,000 volumes, and a News Room
used regularly by about 5,000 readers a day. It also
maintains three Branch Libraries of 10,000 volumes each,
with capacious and well supplied News Rooms, and two
others of smaller dimensions opened only at night.
Altogether these various departments issue more than
2,000 volumes, and accommodate in the Reading and
News Rooms more than 11,000 readers <i>daily</i>.</p>

<p>These Free Libraries were commenced tentatively
and modestly in a leased house and shopping in Constitution
Hill (or Northern part) in 1861, some doubts
apparently existing then whether such institutions were
really needed or would be appreciated here.</p>

<p>The Library commenced with 6,000 volumes, and an
issue for the first year of 108,000. <i>Now</i> there are nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
140,000 volumes available, with an issue of 844,000 per
annum, and one of the most urgent pleas on behalf of
and <i>by</i> the population now before the Town Council is
for <i>more</i> Free Libraries.</p>

<p>So strong is the desire for the privileges these Libraries
afford, that at Ward Elections the question has been
asked of Councillors as a test of political fitness: “Will
you vote for a Free Library and News Room for this
Ward?”</p>

<p>This general willingness of the people to be taxed for
the higher benefits of knowledge and culture for themselves
and their children is sufficiently novel to be worthy
of notice.</p>

<p>The success of the experiment at Constitution Hill
induced the Free Libraries’ Committee to prepare plans
on a scale commensurate with the demands of the Town,
and it was resolved to commence the Central and
Western Libraries consisting of Reference Department
and Reading Room, Central Lending Library and News
Room, and to provide Branch Libraries and News
Rooms for the Eastern District at Gosta Green, and for
the Southern District at Deritend.</p>

<p>This plan has since been extended to provide Libraries
and News Rooms at Nechells, Small Heath, and Spring
Hill, (these three have yet to be built). The small and
incommodious Room at Constitution Hill or Northern
District, the starting point in 1861 of the Libraries, was
superseded by a large and handsome building in July
1883. The cost of these buildings was defrayed from
loans borrowed on the system of an annual repayment of
loan and interest in one hundred years.</p>

<p>The first Reference Library of 16,000 volumes, with
the Central Lending Department and News Room, was
opened in October, 1866, and an eloquent and original
address by the late George Dawson, declared these
Libraries open and free for ever, and started them on their
course of usefulness. As regards the character of
books read, it may be said that by far the largest demand
in the Reference Library is for books of practical value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in Science and Art, and that the taste for Scientific
Works in the Lending Libraries is steadily growing,
and the Committee are only too glad to meet the
demand.</p>

<p>These Free Lending Libraries seem to reach all classes
with their elevating and gladdening influence. There
are not only books for the student and worker by which
they may be helped in the business of life, but there are
books for the weary, books of standard music, books for
little children, and even books for the blind.</p>

<p>The History of the Libraries has been, with one exception,
an unbroken record of success, and what a world of
happiness and growth twenty-five years of successful
Library work means it is very difficult to measure or
estimate.</p>

<p>The exception was the calamitous fire which occurred
on January 11, 1879. The Building was in process of
enlargement, and had been to a considerable extent given
up into the builders’ hands during its reconstruction. A
strong wall had given place for the time being&mdash;to avoid
the closing of the Reference Library and News Room
during the alterations&mdash;to temporary arrangements of wood
and similar material. The winter was severe, the gas was
frozen, an energetic workman in attempting to produce a
thaw ignited a flame which blazed up beyond his control,
set fire to the temporary screen dividing the existing
Library from the extension, and, spreading to the adjoining
shelves, soon embraced the whole of the Library in one
vast blaze. As this occurred at mid-day on a Saturday, the
Rooms of the Library were crowded with Readers, but no
one was injured. All sorts and conditions of men strove
to save what could be saved of the precious books, but
the fire was master, and the salvage was small. The pride
the people had in <i>their</i> Free Library, and their grief at its
destruction were shewn in a most pathetic manner, books
being offered from their own collections, great and small,
toward the restoration. Nor was this feeling confined to
the town. Her Majesty sent a note through Lieutenant-General
Ponsonby, in which she offered a valuable
selection of books as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Buckingham Palace, March 24, 1879.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sir,</p>

<p>I am commanded by the Queen to enquire if
the Managers of the Birmingham Library will accept
from Her Majesty the volumes, a list of which I
enclose.</p>

<p>Not being certain to whom I should address
myself, I have ventured to trouble you with this letter,
in the hope that you will communicate the Queen’s
offer in the proper quarter.</p>

<p class="indent20">I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>

<p class="indent30">Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="indent40">HENRY F. PONSONBY.”</p>

<p class="noindent">“The Mayor of Birmingham.”</p>

</div>

<p>The books offered were:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">Lepsius, (C. R.)&mdash;Denkmaeler aus Aegypten und
Aethiopien. 12 vols., large folio.</p>

<p class="hanging">Bock, (F.)&mdash;Die Kleinodien des heiligen Römischen

</div>

<p class="smaller">[These works, the noblest of their kind, and on the subjects of
which they treat, are not only costly but exceedingly useful, more
especially the fine illustrations in the “Monuments of Egypt and
Ethiopia,” and the “Art Treasures of the Holy Roman Empire of
the German Nation.”]</p>

<p>Expressions of sympathy and gifts of books came
from Germany, Italy, America, and, from nearly every town
in England.</p>

<p>The chief men of Birmingham met, and subscriptions
amounting to nearly £15,000 were given to supplement
the amount for which the books had been insured&mdash;to
raise again and at once what all classes proudly and
lovingly called “Our Free Library.”</p>

<p>The buildings in Ratcliff Place have risen again in
nobler proportions, and on extended space, the rates for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
their support are ungrudgingly given, and there is no
place better used.</p>

<p>The issue of books extends yearly with the advance of
education, and goes on to supply that for which the
school creates a demand.</p>

<p>The student will here find placed at his service the
most complete and costly works in art, architecture,
archæology, botany, natural history, science, theology,
politics, poetry, as well as county histories, and topographical
works, and sets of all the principal weekly,
monthly, quarterly and annual publications, with files of
important newspapers, etc., from very early periods to the
present time.</p>

<p>The Library contains several <i>special</i> collections:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">The <span class="smcap">Byron</span> collection (275 vols.), given by Mr. Richard

<p>A collection of local literature of unequalled extent,&mdash;the
acquisition of many years by David Malins, Sam:
Timmins and others&mdash;has been generously placed at the
disposal of the town. This remarkable collection of
books, pamphlets, Acts of Parliament, maps, views of the
buildings, portraits, etc., already consists of over 6,000
articles, and is catalogued in a pamphlet of 93 pages.</p>

<p><b>The Shakespeare Memorial Library</b> was founded
at the Tercentenary of Shakespeare’s Birth (in 1864) by
the united exertions of Mr. Sam: Timmins and the late
George Dawson. The original collection destroyed by the
fire has been restored to more than its former proportions,
and now consists of upwards of 7,000 volumes, editions,
plays, and Shakespeariana in twenty-six languages, including
the first four folio editions of Shakespeare’s Works,
and nearly every edition issued since, as well as various
translations from all parts of the world. This collection,
like the rest of the Library is open to all students free, and
is largely used, students of Shakespeare coming here from
Cambridge, Dublin, and even from Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The disastrous fire of 1879 destroyed the larger part
of the Cervantes Library, and of the splendid Staunton
Collection of Warwickshire Books, Manuscripts, Engravings,
Portraits, etc., but these are being replaced as fully
as possible by gifts and purchases as opportunities occur.</p>

<p><b>The Reference Library</b> (only) has been opened on
Sundays, from 3 to 9, since April, 1872, and is generally
well used. The readers are supplied with books by
six Assistants, of whom five are Jews.</p>

<p><b>Suburban Libraries.</b>&mdash;The influence of the Birmingham
Free Libraries has not been confined to the
boundaries of the Borough. In the spirited suburban
Manor of Aston a Free Library was established in May
1877; this was followed by Handsworth in 1880; and
both these Suburbs have handsome provision made
in the public buildings, for good Libraries and News
Rooms. The Librarian of Aston Manor Free Library
is Mr. R. K. Dent, the author of “Old and New
Birmingham,” and Mr. J. W. Roberts is the Librarian of
Handsworth.</p>

<p>Within a circle of ten or twelve miles there are
substantial Free Libraries at Darlaston, Dudley, Bilston,
Brierley Hill, Smethwick, West Bromwich, Walsall,
Wednesbury and Willenhall; and within a little wider
radius will be found the Free Libraries of Burslem,
Coventry, Hanley, Kidderminster, Leamington, Lichfield,
Tamworth, Tipton, Wolverhampton, and Worcester; a
larger number within such an area than will be found
in any other part of the kingdom.</p>

LITERARY, SCIENTIFIC AND
ARTISTIC SOCIETIES.</h3>

<p class="author">BY SAM: TIMMINS.</p>

<p>The Chapter II., on “Education,” has included the
more active and valuable societies which have developed
into important organizations for the full and regular
teaching of Literature, Science, and Art, but it has
been thought desirable to give a brief summary of the
local societies which for nearly a century have assisted
in creating the demand which the larger institutions have
been established to supply. Birmingham has not been so
remarkable as some other towns for its societies formed of
lovers of literature and science, and it is certainly remarkable,
and almost reprehensible, that so large a centre has
never had a definite Literary Society or Literary Club,
associating all, and they are many, who are lovers of books
in all departments, and not merely of literature of a
scientific, technical, and practical kind. Such a society, or
such a club, should certainly exist in a great Midland town,
as in Manchester, Liverpool, and other places.</p>

<p><b>The Lunar Society</b> of the last century, which
included among its members or visitors, Priestley, Boulton,
Watt, Darwin, Withering, Keir, Galton, Sir Joseph Banks,
Smeaton, Edgeworth, Day, Wedgwood, Baskerville, was
founded about 1765, and as the houses of the members
were distant from each other, and the roads dark and
sometimes dangerous at night, the meetings were held at
“full moon,” hence “The Lunatics” or “Lunar Society”
derived its name. Its objects were social and scientific
rather than literary and it has left no literary memorials of
its meetings.</p>

<p><b>Debating Societies.</b>&mdash;Among the earliest of the
societies, common in later days, and which were the more
needful when newspapers were few, were the Debating
Societies, the first of which, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> “Robin Hood Free
Debating Society,” was a tavern-society, founded in 1774,
and was followed in the same year by another, and probably
a rival, or seceded body, as a “Society for the Encouragement
of Free and Candid Disputation,” but both soon
discussed themselves out of existence. In 1789 a
“Society for Free Debate” was formed, and like the
others it discussed social, moral, and political questions,
so that in 1792 the magistrates interfered, on the ground
that the recent riots should discourage public discussions
of dangerous subjects.</p>

<p><b>Philosophical Institution.</b>&mdash;At the close of the
century, about the year 1794, a Philosophic and Artistic
Society was proposed, and in 1800 the first steps were
taken to found the Birmingham Philosophical Institution,
which was so successful that, in 1813, a suitable building,
with a lecture room for two hundred hearers, a news room,
a museum, and other necessary rooms, were erected, and
were opened by a lecture by Rev. J. Corrie, a friend and
biographer of Priestley, in October, 1814. This society
flourished for many years, with lectures from eminent
men, a good library and museum, and was finally succeeded
by the Midland Institute on a much larger and
more popular scale. One of its notable practical uses was
the erection of Mr. Follett Osler’s first Anemometer, and
excellent Clock for public convenience. For many years
papers were read and discussed by members, and published
in Transactions in which meteorological, industrial,
and scientific facts of historic importance have been
preserved.</p>

<p><b>Society of Arts and Exhibitions.</b>&mdash;In April,
1814, the “artists and amateurs,” proposed to form a
society, and to hold an annual exhibition of pictures,
and the promoters secured as honorary members, Benjamin
West, Sir J. Soane, J. M. W. Turner, John Flaxman,
and Richard Westmacott. The first exhibition was held
in the “Academy of Arts,”&mdash;a building still remaining
in Union Passage&mdash;and proved very attractive. In 1821,
the Artistic Society proposed to expand and to form
a Society of Arts, and in 1822, the site of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
large building (then temporary) was secured, and replaced,
in 1827, by a permanent building, chiefly from the
liberality of Sir Robert Lawley, who gave a large number
of casts from antique, and in that year the first great exhibition
of pictures was held. As a proof of the necessity
of such an exhibition and of such a Society, it will be
worth while to quote the remarks of Catherine Hutton,
the daughter of the historian, herself a woman of good
sense and good taste, since she predicted that the proposed
society would “die a natural death,” that the “genius of
the artists of Birmingham was more calculated to paint
tea boards than pictures,” and that the proposed rooms
would soon “serve for a Methodist Meeting House.”
For more than sixty years since that prophecy, the rooms
have been used, with one interval, caused by quarrels, for
a series of exhibitions of paintings and drawings, not only
in autumn, but in spring exhibitions too, which secure
some of the best pictures by the foremost artists of the
day.</p>

<p><b>School of Medicine and Surgery.</b>&mdash;In 1828,
the School of Medicine and Surgery was begun in
Snow Hill, by the late W. Sands Cox, and was finally
expanded into the Queen’s College, which has been fully
described, but the “Society” side of this and other similar
institutions, was originally a series of meetings of members,
and not any sort of college or school.</p>

<p><b>Mechanics’ Institute and Artisans’ Library.</b>&mdash;The
success of Dr. Birkbeck’s popular institution in
London led to the formation of a Mechanics’ Institution
in Birmingham, in 1825, and the establishment of an
Artisan’s Library. From various causes this society was
not successful, but it was one of the first attempts to reach
the masses of the people with literary and scientific
teaching, and numerous classes were well taught and gave
valuable help to the young men of that day. One
of the most remarkable results of the Mechanics’ Institution,
and one of the causes, unfortunately, of its failure,
was one of the first of Industrial Exhibitions of manufactures
and processes in 1840, and followed by a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
which was financially a failure. In 1841 another “Institution”
on a somewhat different plan was established under
the patronage of Lord John Manners and the “Young
England” party as the “Athenic Institute” for mental,
moral, and physical improvement, combined with rational
amusements&mdash;athletic and others. In 1843 the Polytechnic
Institution followed and was carried on
successfully till 1853 on rather broader lines than the
Mechanics’ Institution, but it attracted rather the middle
than the humbler classes, and finally failed, to be followed
by the Midland Institute as previously described.</p>

<p>In 1850 an important society was founded in Birmingham
to advocate the establishment of “free, secular, and
compulsory” education, and this developed into the
“National Public School Association,” and in 1867 into
the “National Education League,” which was the most
important factor in the education of the country by the
agitation which resulted in the Elementary Education Act
of 1870.</p>

<p>In 1852-53 another attempt was made to form a Literary
and Scientific Institution, to take up the work which the
Mechanics’ Institution and the Polytechnic Institution had
failed to accomplish. The first public help given was by
one of the first public readings of the Christmas Carol, by
Charles Dickens, which produced for the three readings,
£227. 19s. 9d., and continued the interest and help which
Dickens had given as President of the Polytechnic
Institution some years before. From this date the Midland
Institute has most successfully provided for all classes, by
its literature and science classes, its public lectures, and its
musical and archæological sections, and has become one
of the most successful of all similar institutions.</p>

<p><b>Magazines and Pamphlets.</b>&mdash;So early as 1764 a
“Birmingham Register and Entertaining Museum” had
been published on the lines of the Gentleman’s Magazine,
and ten years later a “Medical Miscellany” appeared
which, however, did not live long, and no similar serial
appeared till 1817. During the whole of this period, and
especially just before or after the riots in 1791, the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was deluged with pamphlets, chiefly on political subjects,
and great feuds arose. The pupils of the famous
“Hazelwood School” issued the “Hazelwood Magazine,”
often illustrated with etchings and lithographs from 1822
to 1830, and the pupils of King Edward’s School have from
time to time had a “Magazine” of their own. This
example was followed by the “Proprietary School” on two
or three occasions. “The Oscotian” in 1828 reached
3 vols., and was resumed later, and is still issued. For
several years, <i>circa</i> 1830, several Magazines devoted to
the drama were published, and were useful in their day.</p>

<p><b>Newspapers.</b>&mdash;The pamphlets of the last century
were superseded by the newspaper press; Birmingham,
which had a “Journal” in 1731, and a “Gazette” in 1741;
had its first “Daily Press” in 1855, when the taxes on
knowledge were repealed, and “Daily Post” in 1857, and
“Daily Gazette” in 1862. In 1869, an attempt was made
to establish a Midland “Illustrated News,” which continued
for some two years. In the same year the first
halfpenny evening paper appeared, the “Daily Mail,”
and in 1871, the “Birmingham Morning News” was
established, with the late George Dawson as its first
editor.</p>

<p><b>Magazines.</b>&mdash;Magazine literature has often been
attempted since 1764, but not successfully. In 1876, the
“Birmingham Examiner,” a weekly newspaper of politics
and literature was tried for some months, and about the
same time the “Medical Review,” the “Midland
Naturalist,” and the “Central Literary Magazine,” were
founded and flourish still. An illustrated Magazine,
“Mid-England” appeared in 1879, but failed to secure the
“Midland” readers; and the “Midland Antiquary,”
devoted to archæology, genealogy, and heraldry, since
1879.</p>

<p><b>Debating Societies</b> have been numerous, and have
generally held their ground, and helped to train some of
the best speakers and debaters of our day. The
Birmingham Debating Society was founded in 1846, and
amalgamated with the Edgbaston Society in 1855.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Parliamentary Debating Societies&mdash;“echoes” of the
House of Commons&mdash;have been tried two or three times
but without success, although flourishing for some years.
The Central Literary Association has been one of the
most long-lived and popular of debating societies, and
its Magazine has also been a marked success. In
1856 an Amateur Dramatic Club was formed, and many
very excellent performances were given. A Dramatic
Club, holding winter meetings, has been established
since for the reading of papers, and the celebration
of the Shakespeare Anniversary; and “Our Shakespeare
Club” has met for more than thirty years as a social rather
than literary club, whose chief work was to found the
Shakespeare Memorial Library. A Graduates Club was
founded by the late Dr. C. Badham for social meetings
of University Graduates; a Clef Club has recently
been opened for lovers of music; the Historical
Society, at Mason College, has been merged into
the Philosophical Society, which meets in the
same building; the Natural History and Microscopical
Society has many and devoted members; the Law
Society has its learned discussions; the Medical
Institute has its Library and Meetings; the students of
the Midland Institute and of Mason College have their
respective societies and magazines; the Archæological
section of the Institute has its meetings, excursions, and
transactions; the Natural History Society its numerous
members, and its excursions and magazine,&mdash;all being
social as well as scientific, and helping to raise the
standard of taste and knowledge among all classes of
the town.</p>

CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.</h3>

<p class="author">BY C.E. MATHEWS.</p>

<p><b>The Birmingham General Hospital.</b>&mdash;At the
commencement of the second half of the last century,
Birmingham was a small manufacturing town with a
population but little in excess of 30,000 souls. At that
time no medical or surgical relief could be obtained by its
suffering poor except at the Infirmary attached to the
Workhouse. But in November, 1765, Dr. Ash, an eminent
member of the local medical profession, called a meeting
of the principal inhabitants “to consider the advisability
of establishing a general hospital for the relief of the sick
and lame.”</p>

<p>A public meeting was held at the Swan, November 21,
1765, which resulted in “Benefactions” £1,555 18s. 0d.
and “Annual Subscriptions” £424 10s. 0d.</p>

<p>Little was done (other than the creation of a building
debt) until the year 1779, when this great charity fairly
entered upon its long career of humanity, usefulness, and
honour.</p>

<p>Its income in those early years was scanty, its patients
few and far between, it had no endowment whatever. It
was a privileged institution, that is, except in cases of
extreme urgency, its benefits were given only to the holders
of subscribers’ tickets.</p>

<p>During the year 1885, 3,545 in-patients and 38,501 out-patients
were treated at this Institution. Its subscription
list amounted to £5,448; the income of its endowments
reached the respectable figure of £2,787, and the total
income from all sources, ordinary and extraordinary, was
nearly £15,000.</p>

<p>It is still in theory a privileged institution; but more
than two-thirds of the in-patients, and more than half of
the out-patients were admitted in 1885 as “accidents and
urgent cases” without recommendation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>In recent years enormous improvements have been
made both in the laws and in the administration of this
Hospital.</p>

<p>The old system by which every Governor had a vote in
the election of a Medical Officer has been abolished, and
vacancies for the much coveted position of Physician or
Surgeon to the charity are now filled by a sufficiently large
and representative Committee.</p>

<p>The legacies, which are very numerous, are funded to
the extent of one half of their amount; and the annual
reports are models for clearness and accuracy of
information.</p>

<p>A great extension of the hospital work has recently
been made. A branch Hospital for chronic cases has
been established by the munificence of Mr. John Jaffray,
and has recently been opened by the Prince of Wales.
The Endowment Fund of this department already exceeds
£30,000, and special subscriptions have been obtained
amounting to nearly £500 a year.</p>

<p>The great Triennial Musical Festivals, which in late years
have ceased to be peculiar to Birmingham, were first established
in connection with the Birmingham General Hospital.
A Committee of the Governors is specially appointed to
carry out these important undertakings, and they have
spared no effort in procuring the finest music from the
ablest Composers, rendered by the foremost artists of the
time. The Elijah of Mendelssohn, the Eli and Naaman
of Costa, the Light of the World of Sullivan, the St.
Peter of Benedict, and the Redemption and Mors et Vita
of Gounod, are some of the great works first produced at
Birmingham under the management of the “Orchestral
Committee,” whose aim has been on the one hand to
obtain the perfection of music, and on the other to
augment the income of the Hospital.</p>

<p>These Festivals have been held since the year 1768,
and have resulted in a net profit to the Hospital of over
£120,000. Since the year 1849, the gross receipts at any
Festival have never been less than £10,000, and in one
year they exceeded £16,000. In the year 1885, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
last Festival was held, the gross receipts were £13,715,
and the net profit accruing to the Charity was £3,500.</p>

<p><b>The Queen’s Hospital.</b>&mdash;This great Hospital is the
second general Hospital in Birmingham. It was founded
in the year 1840, in connection with the Birmingham
School of Medicine and Surgery; a School which in 1843
became incorporated under the name of the “Queen’s
College.”</p>

<p>It has an unusually large acting Medical and Surgical
Staff consisting of three Physicians, four Surgeons, one
Physician for Out-patients, two casualty Surgeons, an
Ophthalmic Surgeon, a Dental Surgeon, and an Obstetric
Officer. It was established as a privileged Institution,
but in the year 1875 the regulations then existing were
changed, and it became a Free Hospital. From that
time no privileges of any kind have been given to subscribers,
and the suffering and deserving poor have been
received and treated without any conditions or qualifications
other than the urgency of their need of relief.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that since the Hospital became free,
it has gained greatly in public confidence and popularity.</p>

<p>The In-patients treated in 1885 were 1,944, the Out-patients
were 24,063. Some years ago it had a considerable
endowment, but great enlargements and
improvements of the Hospital were necessary, and were
carried out a few years since at a cost of £26,000, of
which sum £10,000 was taken from the endowment, and
the remainder was raised by an active and intelligent
Committee. The present endowment is only about
£5,000. The annual income from all sources may be
taken at £8,000, and the annual expenditure is about the
same, though there is no doubt that with a larger income
the Committee could provide in the present buildings a
great increase in the number of beds, and so materially
reduce the average cost per patient. The ordinary income
of a medical charity is derived from subscriptions,
donations, legacies, and the income resulting from investments.
By the laws of many charities legacies are
invested, and the income only of such investments is
applied to the annual purposes of the charity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen’s Hospital has not been able to take this
course; all legacies paid in any year being applied to the
general purposes of the institution.</p>

<p>In the year 1885 the income of the Hospital was made
up as follows:&mdash;From Subscriptions £2,648, from Donations
£256, from Legacies £1,621, from Registration
Fees £852, from Income of Investments £197; but
these figures amount in all only to £5,574, and it has
been stated that the income of the Hospital is about
£8,000 a year. How then has the balance been obtained?
In England there is no compulsory rate in aid of our
charitable institutions. M. Guizot left it on record that
when he first visited this country nothing surprised him
more than the constant recurrence of the words that met
him at every turn in London&mdash;“supported by voluntary
contributions.” But the income arising from “ordinary
sources” was rarely sufficient to enable Hospital managers
to cope with the responsibilities thrown upon them
without incurring constant deficits and sometimes financial
disaster.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago some Birmingham men, amongst
whom the late Rector of Birmingham (Dr. J. C. Miller)
deserves most honourable mention, grappled with the
difficulty. The various Clergy and Ministers of Religion,
assisted by prominent lay townsmen, determined to
organise a general Collection once a year in all the
Churches and Chapels of the town and neighbourhood,
for the benefit of the local Medical Charities. Thus
originated “Hospital Sunday.” It was resolved that
every third year the whole collection should go to the
General Hospital, every third year to the Queen’s Hospital,
and every third year that it should be divided among the
smaller Medical Charities in certain proportions based
upon the number of patients relieved.</p>

<p>“Hospital Sunday” became immensely popular, and
the example set by Birmingham was imitated by the
metropolis and by the larger towns and cities of England.
Since its establishment up to last year the medical
charities of Birmingham have received from the Hospital
Sunday Fund the enormous subsidy of £124,430.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>From this source the Queen’s Hospital has received,
up to the year 1884, £42,188; its triennial collection
amounted to £4,356 in 1881, and to £4,181 in 1884.
But the year 1873 witnessed a new departure. It was
felt that it was not enough to make collections only from
the habitual frequenters of churches and chapels, most of
whom might be assumed to be regular subscribers to the
various charities or donors to their funds. It was felt too
that the great body of the artisan population were able
and willing to do something for the support of the great
institutions founded almost wholly for their benefit; and
thus “Hospital Saturday” became a friendly but formidable
rival to “Hospital Sunday.” Once a year collections
are made in all the manufactories and large workshops in
the town and district, and up to, and including the year
1885, the hospitals have been subsidised from this
welcome source to the extent of £46,800. Not only so,
but these annual collections are steadily growing in
amount, to the great credit of the industrial population
and to the lasting benefit of the charities of the town.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the increasing annual amount
the Queen’s Hospital has thus received. In the year
1880 it was £670; in 1881, £711; in 1882, £852; in
1883, £931; in 1884, £1,056; in 1885, £1,135, and
the accounts for the present year shew a large increase on
any figures hitherto recorded.</p>

<p><b>The Birmingham General Dispensary.</b>&mdash;This
Institution is the oldest medical charity in Birmingham
except the General Hospital. It was founded in 1794,
and has deservedly enjoyed a very large share of public
confidence. It is a strictly privileged institution. Every
subscriber has so many tickets for his subscription, and
has also the power of procuring supernumerary tickets.
There are of course no beds, all patients being attended
at their own homes. Accidents or urgent cases, such as
sometimes put great pressure upon the resources of a
general hospital, are here extremely rare. There is,
therefore, no debt. The services of the medical staff
can be purchased at a rate sufficient to cover the cost.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Consequently the subscription list has always been large,
the finances invariably prosperous, the revenue always in
excess of the expenditure. So great has been the success
of this institution, that the managers sometimes hardly
know what to do with their money.</p>

<p>The income for the year 1885 from all sources was
considerably in excess of £6,000. The whole expenditure
was under £5,000, and the managers were able out
of the income of the year to put by £1,500. The
income from investments alone was £608. There was
a considerable sum on deposit, and a large credit balance
at the Bank. There is a central dispensary in Union
Street, and branches at Camp Hill, Aston, and Ladywood,
all with Resident Surgeons attached.</p>

<p>In former days it had a large midwifery and vaccination
department, but the former was abandoned in 1869
and the latter in 1870. The dispensary, therefore, now
addresses itself only to the ordinary medical treatment of
the sick poor. All the medical officers, including the
consulting officers, are paid for their services. The
patients who, in 1871, numbered 10,570, had increased
in 1885 to 21,888.</p>

<p><b>The Orthopædic and Spinal Hospital.</b>&mdash;This
small but useful institution has existed since the year
1817. It has three Acting-Surgeons, and one Assistant
Surgeon. The Surgeons attend daily and give gratuitous
advice to the deformed poor. Ordinary cases are
admitted without letters of recommendation, but in the
numerous cases where supports or instruments are
required, subscribers’ tickets are necessary to cover the
cost. The instruments supplied in 1885 cost upwards of
£500. The new cases in that year were 1,654, the
attendances 7,439. The total expenditure was about
£1,400.</p>

<p><b>The Eye Hospital.</b>&mdash;The Birmingham and Midland
Eye Hospital is one of the best special Hospitals in the
provinces. It has not only been of incalculable service
to the poor of the town and neighbourhood, but it has
founded an important school of ophthalmic science in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the Midland district. Diseases of the eye cannot be
adequately dealt with at general hospitals. Where the
delicacies and difficulties of any disorder are such as to
require minute manipulative skill and practitioners of
great experience, a special Institution is imperatively
necessary. This Hospital has had a really splendid
career. It was founded in 1824, and commenced its
operations in a humble manner in Cannon Street. It
then migrated into improved premises in Steelhouse Lane.
In 1861 it found a third home in Temple Row, and in
1884 a new Hospital was erected and opened in Church
Street capable of accommodating 70 beds.</p>

<p>The acting Medical Officers of the Institution (exclusive
of House or Resident Surgeons) are by the laws
to consist of not less than four and not more than six
Honorary Surgeons, so that ample provision is made to
secure the adequate surgical treatment of the present
patients and of any probable increase in their number.</p>

<p>In order to insure the maximum of surgical ability
every acting Surgeon is bound to resign his appointment
on his attaining the age of 55 years, or on becoming
physically unable to discharge his duties in an efficient
manner.</p>

<p>In the year 1885 there were 925 in-patients and 13,461
out-patients. 590 operations were performed during the
year on in-patients alone.</p>

<p>The annual income is large, but as yet hardly adequate
to meet the requirements of the new Hospital. The income
for 1884 was £3,807, and the expenditure £3,213; but
the income for 1885 was only £3,098, whilst the expenditure
was £4,187.</p>

<p><b>The Lying-in Charity.</b>&mdash;This is a small but most
useful and deserving Institution. It was founded as a
Lying-in Hospital in the year 1842. Its original
managers attempted to deal not only with lying-in cases
in the wards of the Hospital, but also with the ordinary
diseases of women, and with children. The Institution
was never successful, chiefly because it attempted too
much. As a rule no Institution devoted to more than one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
speciality succeeds. Moreover, when the statistics of
Lying-in Hospitals came to be examined, it was discovered
that there was a great difference in the mortality
of patients treated in Hospitals and of patients treated
at their own homes. In the year 1874, the system of the
charity was remodelled, a large building was abandoned,
and patients were attended only at home. The change
has proved eminently successful. Four competent Midwives
are regularly employed, all of whom have large
experience. The medical staff consists of a consulting
Surgeon and four acting Surgeons who are called in in
cases of difficulty or danger. The competence of the
Midwives is best tested by the fact that the services of
the members of the honorary medical staff are only
required on an average once in 44 cases.</p>

<p>In the year 1885, 931 cases were attended at a cost of
less than £500. Few institutions in Birmingham have
in recent years done better work at a more reasonable
cost than the Lying-in Charity.</p>

<p><b>Free Hospital for Sick Children.</b>&mdash;This Hospital
has been one of the most successful ever founded in
Birmingham. It is a general Hospital so far as regards
disease, but a special Hospital so far as regards age.</p>

<p>It was founded in 1861, and was opened for the reception
of patients on the 1st January, 1862, and during that
year its income and expenditure were about £700. In
the year 1885, its in-patients were 713. Home patients,
27. Out-patients, 12,692. Its income and expenditure
exceeded £4,000.</p>

<p>Few local institutions have ever enjoyed greater
popularity. The Charity from its very name appeals to a
very wide circle, and the administration has been marked
by foresight and discretion. Not only was it the first
Free Hospital in the town, but it was established on
principles then considered novel, but which have since in
part at least been adopted by other local institutions.</p>

<p>For instance, the tenure of office of physicians and
surgeons is limited, and the medical officers, though
absolute in their own department, cannot sit upon the
Board of Management.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, at this Hospital, first in Birmingham, was an
honest effort made to limit the relief given to the <i>Hospital
population</i> only, that is to those who were above pauperism,
but below the capability of paying for medical advice.
Here too, the system was first adopted of paying the
Junior members of the Medical Staff, and here also was
the principle first laid down of vesting the election of
medical officers of the charity in a large and representative
Committee. This rule has been almost unanimously
followed by other local institutions.</p>

<p>The Hospital has a dispensary and out-patient department
in the centre of the town, an in-patient department
with detached fever wards in Broad Street, and a convalescent
department with separate management, many
miles from the town. 151 children were received in the
convalescent home during the year 1885.</p>

<p>The work of the Committee of Management of this
Hospital is supplemented by the kindly aid of a large
Committee of Lady Visitors, and by a Special Committee
of Ladies for the management of the Convalescent Home.</p>

<p><b>The Ear and Throat Hospital.</b>&mdash;This is a small
institution, having for its object the treatment of diseases
of the ear and throat. It has lately been reconstructed
upon a new basis. It is rather a dispensary than a
hospital, having no in-patient department. Tickets can
be obtained by patients desiring the advice of the Medical
officers. The subscription list is under £100 a year, the
income being made up by contributions from the Hospital
Sunday and Hospital Saturday Funds, together with the
amount realised by the sale of supplementary tickets.
The total number of cases treated during the year 1885,
was 2,398.</p>

<p><b>The Dental Hospital.</b>&mdash;This institution was
founded in 1860, and should rather have been termed
the Dental Dispensary than the Dental Hospital. It has
five honorary dental surgeons and four honorary administrators
of anæsthetics. Thus the advantages and resources
of modern dentistry are placed within the reach of those
who but for this institution would undergo much preventable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pain. Every fitting applicant suffering pain is
entitled to advice and attention, but special operations are
performed only upon patients who have a recommendation
from a Governor.</p>

<p>There were 9,453 patients in 1885. The expenditure
was less than £300.</p>

<p><b>The Sanatorium.</b>&mdash;This Institution was founded in
1866, and has proved a most valuable supplement to the
work of our local hospitals. It enables convalescent
patients to obtain rest, pure air and nutritious diet at one
of the most healthy and beautiful spots within a reasonable
distance of Birmingham.</p>

<p>Some years ago a fund had been raised for relief of
distress in the cotton districts, and when the distress had
subsided a considerable portion of the fund remained
undisposed of. With the consent of the donors £4,500
was devoted to forming a nucleus for the Building Fund
of the Sanatorium. The work was completed in 1873.
The total cost of the site, buildings, and furniture was
£16,800.</p>

<p>The institution receives 40 male, and 40 female patients,
and every possible effort is made to provide for their
health and their amusement.</p>

<p>No privileges are given to subscribers; but patients
are received either from the Medical Charities in Birmingham,
or from the general public, on the recommendation
of a medical practitioner.</p>

<p>The income and expenditure are about £2,000 a year.
The charity applies all donations exceeding £10 to a
deposit or investment fund, and ten per cent. of the
amount of the fund so created is withdrawn each year for
the current purposes of the institution.</p>

<p><b>The Homœopathic Hospital and Dispensary.</b>&mdash;This
hospital is supported by the friends of the system of
homœopathy. It has one honorary physician and five
honorary surgeons. It is a general hospital, and has
departments for in-patients, out-patients, and home
patients. The in-patient system is different from that of
most general hospitals, a certain number of beds being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
reserved for patients who can afford to pay for the benefits
they receive. Again, all in-patients are admitted at the
discretion of the medical staff, so that as regards this
department the hospital is free, no subscriber having the
privilege of ensuring a bed. Subscribers have tickets for
out-patients and for home visits. This provision for
visiting patients at their own homes is of great value in
connection with this Charity. The in-patients in 1885
were 167. The home-patients 584. The out-patients
18,752.</p>

<p>The expenditure for 1885 was £1,640. The income
£1,380, leaving a deficit of £260.</p>

<p>Ladies as well as gentlemen serve on the Committee
of Management.</p>

<p><b>The Hospital for Women.</b>&mdash;This is a valuable
and important Institution. When the Lying-in Hospital
gave up the treatment of women’s special diseases and
devoted itself exclusively to midwifery, there was an
opening for an institution for the reception and treatment
of women afflicted with diseases peculiar to their sex.</p>

<p>Two classes of patients are admitted. Paying patients
who contribute the whole or part of the cost of treatment,
and general cases, which are admitted without any
subscriber’s ticket of recommendation. The expenditure
for the year 1884 (no report has been issued for 1885)
was £1,736. The income was £1,466, leaving a deficit
of £270.</p>

<p>During the same year the out-patients were 3,299, and
the in-patients 294.</p>

<p>The acting Medical staff consists of five Surgeons, one
of whom is a lady. It will be obvious that in a Hospital
of this character many operations of cardinal importance
are constantly performed. No fewer than 217 operations
were performed during the year 1884.</p>

<p><b>The Skin and Lock Hospital.</b>&mdash;This Institution
was opened in 1881 for the treatment of skin and lock
diseases. There was ample room for it, no special
department for cases of this kind existing in any of the
general Hospitals of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>During the year 1885 nearly 2,000 cases were treated.
The income of the year amounted to £1,081, and the
expenditure only to £624. The Committee of Management,
however, are desirous of erecting a Hospital, and
thus be enabled to deal with serious cases as in-patients.
A site has been secured for this purpose in John Bright
Street. It is estimated that £5,000 will be required.
£1,200 of which has already been obtained.</p>

<p>The Hospital is conducted on the free system, but
some patients are received on payment of a sum sufficient
to cover the bare cost of their treatment.</p>

<p><b>The Deaf and Dumb Institution.</b>&mdash;This Charity
is an educational establishment. It was founded nearly
three quarters of a century ago for the instruction of deaf
and dumb children. 70 boys and 58 girls were on the
books during the year 1885. The Charity is supported
by voluntary contributions, supplemented to a considerable
extent by payments on behalf of the inmates.</p>

<p>Children are admitted by election, and the election
takes place at the Annual General Meeting. Every
Governor is entitled to one vote in respect of a donation
of £10, or an annual subscription of £1. 1s. Children
admitted without election pay £25 per annum. Elected
children pay £10 if they come from Warwickshire,
Worcestershire, or Staffordshire; £15 if they come
from other Counties, and £20 if maintained by Boards
of Guardians. The system of education is excellent.
Children are taught not only by means of the manual
alphabet but by articulation and lip reading, in cases
where that system can be advantageously employed.</p>

<p>The Institution is placed in a healthy and beautiful
situation in Church Road, Edgbaston.</p>

<p>The income for the year 1885 was £2,726, made up
as follows:&mdash;Subscriptions £461, Legacies £804, Donations
£63, Interest on Investments £400, Payments for
Pupils £986, Sundries £12. Total £2,726.</p>

<p>The expenditure was about £100 in excess of the
income. There is no rule as to funding legacies. The
charity does excellent work and is deservedly popular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The General Institution for the Blind.</b>&mdash;This
Institution has been of immense benefit to the town and
neighbourhood. The buildings are handsome and commodious,
and are situated in a charming part of Edgbaston,
about two miles from the centre of Birmingham. The
Charity was founded thirty-eight years ago. The expenditure
in 1885 was a little in excess of £4,200, whilst the
income, including sales of materials manufactured by the
inmates, reached the large sum of £6,270. The subscriptions
and donations amounted to £778, Legacies
£2,119, the interest on investments was £734. Payments
by Pupils £765, Sales £1,874. Here too
the legacies are not funded. But the large sum received
from legacies in 1885, together with the balance
in hand at the commencement of that year, enabled the
managers to invest over £2,000 out of the year’s income.</p>

<p>46 males and 32 females were in the Institution in
1885, and 257 adult blind persons were visited and
taught at their own homes.</p>

<p>Great efforts are made by the managers to find
permanent employment for pupils who have been taught
at this excellent charity. Many pupils are turned out
fully competent organists, and many become professional
piano tuners, and follow the trade of basket making.</p>

ECCLESIASTICAL.</h3>

<p class="author">BY G. J. JOHNSON.</p>

<p>The municipal borough of Birmingham comprises the
whole of the parishes of Birmingham and Edgbaston, and
part of the adjoining parish of Aston.</p>

<p>All these parishes were formerly in the Archdeaconry
of Coventry, as part of the diocese of Lichfield and
Coventry, and are now in the same Archdeaconry as part
of the diocese of Worcester. By an Order in Council,
dated 22nd December, 1836, made in pursuance of the
6 &amp; 7 Will. IV., c. 77, the Archdeaconry of Coventry was
taken away from the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry,
and annexed to that of Worcester, and the former diocese
became the diocese of Lichfield only. The testamentary
jurisdiction of the Bishop of Lichfield over the archdeaconry,
however, continued until the jurisdiction of all the ecclesiastical
courts in such matters was abolished as from the
1st of January, 1858, by the 20 and 21 Vic., c. 77.</p>

<p>The original parish of Birmingham (otherwise called
the parish of St. Martin, from the mother church of the
parish dedicated to that Saint) contains 2,660 acres only,
whilst the acreage of the entire borough is 8,420 acres.
The difference is made up of the entire parish of
Edgbaston, 2,790 acres, and part of the parish of Aston,
2,970 acres.</p>

<p>Taking the parishes separately, we commence with the</p>

<h4>PARISH OF BIRMINGHAM.<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></h4>

<p><b>St. Martin’s.</b>&mdash;We find that the earliest mention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the mother church of St. Martin in our national records
is a licence of the 6th of May, 1330 (4 Edward III.), to
Walter de Clodeshale, of Saltley (then an adjoining
hamlet), to grant lands for the endowment of a priest to
say mass daily at the altar of the Virgin in St. Martin’s.
Seventeen years afterwards (21 Edward III.), Richard, son
of Walter de Clodeshale, obtained a licence for a further
grant to endow a second priest to say daily mass.</p>

<p>In 1392 (16 Richard II.), there is a record of a licence
to found and endow a guild in honour of The Holy Cross,
and another chantry in St. Martin’s for two chaplains.
All these charities were suppressed at the time of the
dissolution of the monasteries. The endowments of the
Clodeshale charities were sold,<a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as was also a small part
of the endowments of the Guild of the Holy Cross. The
rest were re-granted by Edward VI. for the foundation
and endowment of the Grammar School.</p>

<p>For three centuries after its foundation St. Martin’s
Church must have been nearly at the top of the town,
which consisted, as Leland saw it even in 1538, of one
long street, namely, the present Digbeth and High Street,
and the old church sufficed for all its wants, especially as
the lower part of the town below Digbeth was served by
the chapel of St. John, noticed under Aston parish.<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The tower and spire, having become unsafe, were taken
down and rebuilt in 1855, and in 1872 the rebuilding of
the rest of the church was commenced, and it was
finished and re-consecrated on the 20th of July, 1875.
Attached to the church are mission rooms in Barwick
Street and Park Street.</p>

<p>The original parish has been, by the successive
agencies of special acts of parliament, the orders of the
Church Building Commissioners (1818 to 1856), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
afterwards of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, or by the
Bishop in exercise of powers given by 1 and 2, W. IV.,
c. 38 (now repealed), divided into five rectories and twenty-one
vicarages (all incumbents of churches entitled to perform
marriages, churchings, and baptisms, and receive the
fees for their own use, being now termed vicars under the
statute 31 and 32 Vic., c. 117). The successive divisions
are detailed in chronological order.</p>

<p><b>St. Philip’s.</b>&mdash;In the early part of the reign of
Queen Anne, Birmingham had extended northwards and
upwards from the mother church, and this necessitated
the foundation of St. Philip’s Church and parish, created
by special Act of Parliament (7 Anne, c. 131, A.D. 1708)
entitled “An Act for building a parish church and
parsonage house, and making a new church and new
parish in Birmingham, to be called the parish of
St. Philip.” The preamble recites that there was only one
church in the parish of Birmingham, and that it was expedient
to build another in the “high town quarter.” It
then carves out of the parish of St. Martin, the parish of
St. Philip, and constitutes it a rectory. The church was
consecrated in 1715, and partly rebuilt and enlarged in
1884. Its situation, between Colmore Row and Temple
Row, is the finest in the town.</p>

<p><b>St. Bartholomew.</b>&mdash;The next ecclesiastical structure
in order of time, was St. Bartholomew’s, built in 1749 as
a chapel of ease to St. Martin’s, to accommodate the then
rapidly increasing population east of St. Martin’s. The
land was the gift of Joseph Jennens, whose name is still
commemorated in Jennens Row. In the year 1847, it
was created a district chapelry, and in 1869, a part of the
district was assigned to the consolidated chapelry of St.
Gabriel. The churchyard and the adjoining burial ground
of St. Martin, containing four acres and a half (called the
Park Street Burial Ground) were, in the year 1880, converted
by the Corporation into a public garden. There is
a mission room in Fox street, attached to the church.</p>

<p>In the year 1772, the first Church Extension Society
was formed in Birmingham for the purpose of building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
“one or more churches,” which resulted in the passing
of another Act of Parliament (12 Geo. III., c. 64, A.D.
1772) “for building two new chapels, and providing
burial places thereto.” The first built of these two
chapels was&mdash;</p>

<p><b>St. Mary’s</b>, completed in 1774 on land granted by
Mary Weaman, who gave her christian name to the church
and her surname to the adjoining street. It was originally
a chapel of ease to St. Martin’s, but was created a district
chapelry in 1841. The chapel was thoroughly renovated
in 1857, and in 1882 the disused burial ground was, at
the cost of the Corporation, laid out as a garden for
public use.</p>

<p><b>St. Paul’s.</b>&mdash;The other of the two churches built
under the act of 1772 was St. Paul’s, in what was then the
northernmost part of Birmingham. It was built in 1779,
on land given by Charles Colmore out of a large estate he
had there. It was created a district in the year 1841.</p>

<p><b>Christ Church</b>, at the top of New Street, which
enjoys the unenviable distinction of being the ugliest
church in the town, was authorised by a special act of
parliament of the year 1803 “for erecting a new church
to be called Christ Church, in the town of Birmingham.”
All the sittings were to be free, and it therefore obtained
the name of “the Free Church.” It was consecrated in
1813, but not finished until three years later. In 1865 it
was constituted a consolidated chapelry out of the parishes
of St. Martin and St. Philip. Attached to the church are
mission rooms in Pinfold street and Fleet street.</p>

<p>This was the last of the churches for which a special
Act of Parliament was required, for in the year 1818, the
Act 58, Geo. III. c. 45, was passed, establishing the
Church Building Commission and granting a sum of one
million (increased six years afterwards to a million and a
half) for building additional churches throughout the
kingdom, and for the division of parishes.</p>

<p><b>St. George’s.</b>&mdash;The first result of this in Birmingham
was St. George’s Church near Tower Street, consecrated
July 30th, 1822. At that time the site was surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
by green fields, and it was known as St. George’s in the
Fields. In pursuance of the provisions of the Act of
1818, it was constituted a separate parish, taken out of
St. Martin’s, and because St. Martin’s was a rectory,
St. George’s became a rectory also. The Church itself
was enlarged in 1882. There are mission rooms in
New Summer Street and Smith Street, licensed for worship.
The district chapelries of St. Stephen and St. Matthias,
have been constituted out of the original parish of
St. George.</p>

<p><b>St. Peter’s</b> in Dale End was consecrated August
10th, 1827, as a chapel of ease to St. Philip’s Church,
in which parish it was. It was destroyed by fire in
1831, and rebuilt in 1837. In 1847, it was constituted
a district chapelry.</p>

<p><b>St. Thomas’s</b> in Holloway Head was consecrated
October 22nd, 1829, and like St. George’s, was constituted
a new parish, carved out of St. Martin’s, and
a rectory under the 58 Geo. III. c. 45. Parts of the
original parish have been assigned to the districts of
Immanuel and St. Asaph.</p>

<p><b>All Saints</b>, built near Lodge Road at Birmingham
Heath, was originally a small Church, consecrated September
28th, 1833, and greatly enlarged in 1881. It is
a parish and rectory formed in the year 1834, out of
St. Martin’s parish, and a portion of the parish has been
since assigned to the district chapelry of St. Cuthbert.
There are two mission halls, one in Heaton Street, and
the other at Nineveh Schoolroom, attached to All Saints.
This was the last of the rectories created under the Act of
1818. All the districts subsequently created have been
either assigned by the Bishop or formed under the Peel
Acts, 1843 and 1844, or the New Parishes (Marquis of
Blandford’s) Act, 1856.</p>

<p><b>Bishop Ryder’s Church</b>, in Gem Street, was built
in 1838, on land granted by the Governors of King
Edward’s Grammar School. It is so called after Dr.
Ryder (b. 1777, d. 1836) who was successively Bishop of
Gloucester (1815-1824), and afterwards of Lichfield and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Coventry (1824-1836), and who greatly interested himself
in church extension in the poorer and more populous
parts of his diocese. In the year 1840 a separate district
was assigned to it.</p>

<p>In the year 1838 a society was formed for building ten
new churches in Birmingham; only five were built, and
these were St. Matthew’s, St. Mark’s, St. Luke’s, St.
Stephen’s, and St. Andrew’s. Three of these, namely,
St. Mark’s, St. Luke’s, and St. Stephen’s were in the
parish of Birmingham. The other two will be noticed
under Aston parish.</p>

<p><b>St. Mark’s</b> is in King Edward’s Road, Summer Hill,
and is built on land granted by the Governors of King
Edward’s Grammar School. It was consecrated in 1841,
and in the same year constituted a district out of St.
Martin’s parish. There is a mission room in Steward
Street.</p>

<p><b>St. Luke’s</b>, in the Bristol Road, almost on the border
of the parish of Edgbaston. It was consecrated September
28th, 1842. In the year 1844 it was constituted a district
parish out of St. Martin’s.</p>

<p><b>St. Stephen’s</b>, Newtown Row, built on part of the
estate of the Governors of King Edward’s Grammar
School, was consecrated July 23rd, 1844, and then constituted
a district chapelry out of the parish of St. George.
A portion of it has since been assigned to the district of
St. Nicolas. There is a mission room in Theodore
Street.</p>

<p><b>St. Jude’s</b>, in Tonk Street, in the midst of one of the
poorest districts of the town, was consecrated 26th July,
1851, and enlarged in 1879. In the year 1845, before the
building of the church, it was constituted a district out
of the parishes of St. Martin and St. Philip.</p>

<p><b>St. John’s</b> (Ladywood), Monument Road, built on
land granted by the Governors of the Free Grammar
School, was consecrated March 15th, 1854. By an order
in Council, gazetted June 20th, 1854, it was constituted
a district chapelry out of St. Martin’s parish, and has since
(1876) had the district chapelry of St. Margaret’s carved
out of it. The church was greatly enlarged in 1881.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p><b>St. Matthias’</b>, Wheeler Street, is the church of a
new district chapelry formed in the year 1856 out of the
parish of St. George, and part of that district has since
been assigned to St. Saviour’s. The church was consecrated
June 4th, 1856, and enlarged in 1879.</p>

<p><b>St. Barnabas’</b>, Ryland Street North. The parish
was formed out of St. Martin’s in the year 1861, the
church having been built and consecrated October 24th,
1860. At a very little distance is</p>

<p><b>Immanuel Church</b>, in Broad Street, which occupies
the site of what was once the chapel of the Magdalen
Asylum. It was consecrated May 7th, 1865, and is the
church of a parish formed in that year out of St. Thomas’s
parish.</p>

<p><b>St. David’s</b>, Bissell Street, is the church of a district
chapelry formed in the year 1866 out of St. Luke’s parish.
The church was consecrated in July, 1865.</p>

<p>In January, 1865, The Birmingham Church Extension
Society was formed. In 1867 Miss Ryland contributed
a sum of £10,000 towards the same objects and subsequently
a second donation of £10,000. Out of these
donations the cost of the churches of St. Gabriel,
St. Lawrence (see Aston), and St. Nicolas was mainly
defrayed.</p>

<p><b>St. Nicolas’</b>, in Lower Tower Street, consecrated
July 12th, 1868, and, by order in Council, 18th June,
1869, constituted a district chapelry out of St. Stephen’s
parish.</p>

<p><b>St. Asaph’s</b>, Great Colmore Street, of which the site
was presented by Mr. Cregoe Colmore, was consecrated
December 8th, 1868. By order in Council, 18th June,
1869, it was constituted a district chapelry out of the
parish of St. Thomas.</p>

<p><b>St. Gabriel’s</b>, in Pickford Street, Digbeth, was consecrated
January 5th, 1869, and by order in Council 7th
August, 1869, was formed as a consolidated chapelry out

<p>Now passing into the</p>

<h4>PARISH OF EDGBASTON.</h4>

<p><b>St. Bartholomew.</b>&mdash;The parish church, dedicated to
St. Bartholomew, is at the junction of Church Road and
Priory Road, and close to Edgbaston Park and Hall.
There is said to have been a church on the site in 775.
The present church now (1886) in course of enlargement
was rebuilt in 1810. The vicars of Edgbaston have been
remarkable for longevity. The Rev. John Pixell, who
was inducted in 1760, was succeeded by his son the Rev.
Charles Pixell in 1794, and he held the living for 54
years. On his death, in 1848, the late Rev. Isaac Spooner
became vicar, and held it until his death in 1884.</p>

<p><b>St. George’s.</b>&mdash;The rapid increase of population in
this parish, the West End of Birmingham, led to the
building of St. George’s Church, at the end of Calthorpe
Road, about half a mile nearer the town than the old
church, to which it was a chapel of ease. It was consecrated
November 28th, 1838. It was greatly enlarged
in 1885, and constituted a separate district in 1852, by the
Church Building Commissioners.</p>

<p><b>St. James’s</b> in St. James’s Road, was another chapel of
ease, consecrated 1st June, 1852. In the same year it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
had a separate district assigned to it by the Church
Building Commissioners.</p>

<p><b>St. Augustine’s</b>, near the top of the Hagley Road,
was built in the year 1867, as another chapel of ease to
Edgbaston Old Church, to serve the increasing population
of the northern portion of the parish. It was consecrated
September 12th, 1868, and cost £9,000. A
tower and spire, added in 1876, cost £4,000 more. It
has not yet (1886) any district legally assigned to it.</p>

<p><b>St. Ambrose</b>, a temporary church, in the Pershore
Road, is another chapel of ease in the southern portion of
the parish. It is the gift of Mrs. Spooner, as a memorial
of her late husband, the Rev. Isaac Spooner, vicar of the
parish 1848 to 1884.</p>

<h4>PARISH OF ASTON.</h4>

<p>We have to deal only with the portion of this parish
which is included in the Borough, and commence with
the chapel of</p>

<p><b>St. John’s</b>, Deritend, which is the second most ancient
church in the town. It is situate just over the Aston
side of the stream which divides that parish from
Birmingham, and was founded in 1375 by some inhabitants
of the hamlets of Deritend and Bordesley,
because of the inconvenience of resorting to the parish
church of Aston, three miles away. The then Lord of
the Manor of Birmingham gave the land, and the inhabitants
built the chapel, and by an agreement, still
extant, dated 29th May, 1381, and made between the
Prior and monks of Tykeford, patrons of the parish
church of Aston, the vicar of Aston, the Lord of the
Manor of Birmingham, and thirteen of the inhabitants of
Deritend and Bordesley, with the consent of the Bishop
of the diocese, then called Coventry and Lichfield, the
inhabitants of Deritend and Bordesley were empowered
to appoint, “at their own charges,” a chaplain to celebrate
divine service in a certain chapel in honor of St. John the
Baptist there lately built.<a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The chaplain is still elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
by the vote of the inhabitants of Deritend and Bordesley,
and down to the year 1842 the proceedings did not differ
from those of a contested political election. The last
election took place June 15th, 1870, when the present
chaplain, the Rev. W. C. Badger, M.A., was elected by a
majority of 1561 votes over his opponent. The present
chapel dates from 1735. There is a mission room in
Darwin Street. Part of the district conventionally
assigned to it was, by order dated 29th December, 1885,
legally created a “Peel district” without a church, by the
name of <b>St. Basil’s</b>.</p>

<p>This chapel of St. John remained from the fourteenth
to the eighteenth century the only chapel of ease to the
parish church of Aston for the increasing population of
that part of the town which gradually extended itself into
Aston parish. In the early part of this century a genteel
suburb had formed itself at the east end of the town, on
the Coleshill road, of which the eastern portions of
Great Brook Street and Ashted Row are still evidences.</p>

<p>Dr. Ash, a celebrated physician of Birmingham, and
founder of the General Hospital, built what Hutton calls
a “sumptuous house” there. When he left it to live in
London it was altered into a proprietary chapel by a
Mr. Brooke, an attorney, who gave his name to the street.
The chapel was opened on the 9th of October, 1791, but
was sold in 1798 and afterwards became&mdash;</p>

<p><b>St. James’s Chapel</b>, Ashted, consecrated August
7th, 1807. From its close proximity to the cavalry
barracks, it was called “The Barrack’s Chapel.” A
separate parish was allotted to it out of the Aston parish,
in the year 1853. There is a mission room in Vauxhall
Road.</p>

<p><b>Holy Trinity Chapel</b>, at the top of Bradford Street,
was the result of a meeting for church extension, held in
October, 1818. It was consecrated 23rd January, 1823,
and a district carved out of Aston parish was allotted to
it in the year 1864. Parts of that district have since been
assigned to St. Alban and All Saints’, Smallheath. There
is a mission hall in Sandy Lane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p><b>St. Matthew’s</b>, Great Lister Street, was consecrated
20th October, 1840, and made the church of a district,
1842. The town has since extended for a mile eastward,
and districts out of St. Matthew’s district have been
carved out and assigned to the district chapelries of St.
Clement, St. Lawrence, and St. Anne, Duddeston, (<i>q.v.</i>)
There is a mission room in Lupin Street.</p>

<p><b>St. Andrew’s</b>, in St. Andrew’s Road, near the
Coventry Road, was consecrated September 30th, 1846,
having been constituted a district chapelry out of the
parish of Aston. Attached is an iron church, dedicated
to <b>St. Oswald</b>, opposite Smallheath Park.</p>

<p><b>St. Clement’s</b>, in Nechells Park Road, was consecrated
August 30th, 1859, and a district out of St.
Matthew’s, Duddeston, assigned to it in 1860. It has a
mission room in High Park Street, and a mission hall in
Cuckoo Road.</p>

<p><b>Christ Church</b>, near the Stratford Road, Sparkbrook,
built on land given by Mr. S. S. Lloyd, was consecrated
October 1, 1867, and a particular district assigned to it
21st November, 1867. There is a mission hall in
Dolobran Road.</p>

<p><b>St. Lawrence’s</b>, in Dartmouth Street, was consecrated
June 25th, 1868, and by order in Council, 14th
September, in the same year, constituted a district chapelry
out of the parish of St. Matthew.</p>

<p><b>St. Anne’s</b>, in Cato Street, Nechells, built partly out
of funds provided by the Church Extension Society, was
consecrated 22nd October, 1869, and by order in Council
of December 7th, was constituted a district chapelry out
of the district of St. Matthew. Attached is a mission
room in Great Francis Street.</p>

<p><b>All Saints’</b>, Cooksey Road, Smallheath, was built by the
friends of the late Rev. Joseph Oldknow, D.D., who was
for many years vicar of Holy Trinity, Bordesley (<i>q.v.</i>) in
memory of him. It was consecrated July 28th, 1883.
It had been previously made a district by order in Council,
5th August, 1875.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><b>St. Catherine’s</b> in Scholefield Street, Nechells, consecrated
November 8th, 1878, and constituted a district
chapelry out of St. Clement’s, Nechells, by order in Council,
dated 20th March, 1879. There is a mission room in
Smith Street.</p>

<p><b>St. Alban the Martyr</b>, at the corner of Conybere
Street and Ryland Street, consecrated May 3rd, 1881.
This is one of the finest churches in the Borough, and the
services are ritualistic. A mission chapel dedicated
to St. Alban was first opened in September, 1865, and, in
1873, a school chapel dedicated to St. Patrick, and
situated in Highgate Street. These are now both attached
to the larger church. By order in Council dated 19th
August, 1871, a district had been previously assigned to
it out of Holy Trinity parish.</p>

<h4>NON-CONFORMISTS.<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></h4>

<p>The earliest Nonconformist place of worship, of which
any record remains, was “The Old Meeting,” which, with
its graveyard, has so recently as the year 1882 been
removed for the enlargement of the railway station in
New Street.</p>

<p>As old Birmingham was not a corporate town it did
not come within the provisions of The Five-Mile Act
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1665), and was naturally the resort of persecuted
Nonconformists from the neighbouring boroughs. On
the first Declaration of Indulgence put forth by Charles
the Second in 1672, rooms were licensed for public
worship, and in 1687 eleven dissenters bought a plot of
land in what was then called Philip Street, and built a
meeting house, finished in 1689, the year of the passing
of The Toleration Act. As the total cost of land and
building was only £220, it could not have accommodat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>ed
many hearers, and we find that another meeting house,
called the “Lower Meeting House,” was built in Deritend
in a yard which was until lately called “Meeting House
Yard,” now taken into the continuation of Milk Street
into Deritend. This second chapel was injured in the
Sacheverell Riots in 1715, and afterwards the congregation
removed, in 1732, to what was formerly the “New
Meeting,” in Moor Street, where they remained until the
last day of the year 1861.</p>

<p>The worshippers at both these two original meeting
houses called themselves, and were called “Presbyterians,”
used as the antithesis to “Episcopalian,” although they
were really “Independent” in their form of church
government. In theology both congregations were at first
Calvinistic, but Mr. Howell, the sixth in succession of the
ministers of the Old Meeting, having become an avowed
Arian, the more orthodox minority withdrew in the year
1747, and founded the church in Carr’s Lane&mdash;(see
“Congregationalists.”) It is creditable to the good feeling
of the separatists that none of them sold their shares in
the “Old Meeting” and one of them was re-appointed
a trustee thirty years afterwards. From Arianism the
congregations of both the Old and New Meetings gradually
became Unitarian and are henceforth treated under that
title.</p>

<p><b>Unitarians.</b>&mdash;The Old Meeting House, built in 1689,
was burned in the riots of 1791, and afterwards rebuilt.
It had attached a burial ground which was used by both
the congregations of the Old and New Meetings, and in
which were interred the remains of many of the
foremost men in the public life of Birmingham for two
centuries.<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> As before stated the meeting house and
ground were sold to the London and North Western
Railway Company in 1882, and the remains of the dead
were transferred to a separate piece of ground in the
Borough Cemetery at Witton, and the Congregation have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
built a new</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Meeting Church</span>, in the Bristol Road, which
was opened in 1885.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The New Meeting House</span>, of which Dr. Priestley was
the minister from 1780 to 1791, was destroyed in the
riots of 1791 and rebuilt on its original site in Moor
Street. The situation having become inconvenient it was
(1861) sold to the Roman Catholics and became St.
Michael’s, Moor Street (<i>q.v.</i>), and the New Meeting
congregation removed to</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Church of the Messiah</span>, Broad Street, opened
1st January, 1862. The Rev. H. W. Crosskey, LL.D., is
the minister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newhall Hill Chapel</span> was next in order of time to
the Old and New Meetings, and was built in 1840 by
members of both congregations, who had previously a house
for worship and Sunday schools in Cambridge Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hurst Street Chapel</span> was built in the year 1844 as a
mission chapel and has been since enlarged. Another
mission more immediately connected with the New
Meeting is</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lawrence Street Chapel</span>, which was originally built
as a place of worship for the Baptists then occupied by
the disciples of Zion Ward, and afterwards used by
the followers of Robert Owen, who were at one time
numerous in Birmingham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Birmingham Free Christian Society</span> have a
chapel in Fazeley Street, served by Lay preachers.</p>

<p><b>Baptists.</b>&mdash;It is somewhat singular that two of the
oldest chapels belonging to this body, namely, Cannon
Street and Freeman Street, have now ceased to exist.
Cannon Street Chapel was built in 1737 on a part
of what was then a cherry orchard (which gave its
name to Cherry Street). The original building was
greatly enlarged in 1806. In those days the well-to-do
tradesmen of Birmingham lived in the town, and
the town chapels consequently drew their occupants
from the immediate neighbourhood. Gradually, however,
the old members died, and their sons and daughters we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>nt
to live in the suburbs, and so Cannon Street, which was
the flourishing mother church of the Particular Baptists,
dwindled in numbers. Fortunately the site of it was
required by the Corporation of Birmingham, and it was
sold for £26,500, and is now occupied by the Central
Arcade in Corporation Street. The purchase money
was, under a scheme sanctioned by the Court of Chancery,
expended in aid of several Baptist chapels in the town
and suburbs.</p>

<p>The Chapel in Freeman Street is said to have been
older than Cannon Street to which place the worshippers
at Freeman Street joined themselves in 1752, and the
edifice itself was taken down in 1856. The next Chapel
in order of date was built in Bond Street (near Constitution
Hill) was opened in the year 1786, and was for
many years a flourishing church, but gradually decayed
in numbers and influence, and is now occupied by the
United Methodists (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The chief existing places of worship now belonging to
the Baptists are</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newhall Street Chapel</span>, originally built in 1791
by the followers of Emanuel Swedenborg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Graham Street</span> or <span class="smcap">Mount Zion Chapel</span>, opened
in 1824 by the celebrated Edward Irving. Twenty years
afterwards the pulpit was occupied for some time by the
late George Dawson, and subsequently, from 1851 to
1874, by the Rev. Charles Vince, whose death was felt
as a public calamity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heneage Street Chapel</span>, of which the foundation
stone was laid 1st of August, 1838, to commemorate the
emancipation of the West Indian negroes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Circus Chapel</span>, Bradford Street, opened 1848, so
called because it was formerly a circus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wycliffe Church</span>, in the Bristol Road, opened
in 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Church of the Redeemer</span>, Hagley Road, built by a
portion of the congregation of Graham Street, aided by a
contribution of the Cannon Street trustees, and opened
in 1882.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>There are also chapels in Guildford Street, Hope Street,
Lodge Road (Hockley), Great King Street, Stratford
Road, Spring Hill, Victoria Street (Small Heath), Warwick
Street (Deritend), and Wynn Street (Great Colmore
Street).</p>

<p>There is also a chapel belonging to the Particular
Baptists of Calvinistic views in Frederick Street (Newhall
Hill), built in 1850 with the proceeds of an old chapel in
Bartholomew Street, which was called the “Cave of
Adullam,” and removed by the extension of the railway
into New Street.</p>

<p>The General or Arminian Baptists had the chapel in
Freeman Street (now removed), and in September, 1786,
opened the existing chapel in <span class="smcap">Lombard Street</span>.</p>

<p><b>Congregationalists.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carr’s Lane.</span>&mdash;This Church
was formed, as before stated, in 1747, by members of the
first Nonconformist Meeting house, the “Old Meeting,”
who did not agree with the Arianism of the then minister,
Mr. Howell. The first building was opened in 1748, and
was then, as was the custom with meeting houses, built in
a yard to screen it from observation. It has been several
times enlarged and rebuilt. The names of the Rev.
John Angell James, who was minister here from 1806
to his death, 1st October, 1859, and of his successor
R. W. Dale, LL.D., the present minister, are known
throughout the christian world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ebenezer Chapel</span>, in Steelhouse Lane, was built in
1818 by the admirers of a minister celebrated in his day,
the Rev. Jehoiada Brewer, who laid the foundation stone
in 1816, but died before the building was finished.<a name="FNanchor_39_40" id="FNanchor_39_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
From endowments furnished by three members of this
congregation, Mr. Mansfield and his two sisters, M<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>iss
Mansfield and Mrs. Glover, a college for the education of
ministers was established at Spring Hill, Dudley Road,
then removed to Moseley, and is now intended to be
reconstituted at Oxford as “Mansfield College.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Highbury Chapel</span>, Graham Street, originally formed
by the remnant of the Livery Street congregation, was
opened in 1845.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Francis Road</span> (Edgbaston) <span class="smcap">Chapel</span> was built to
commemorate the fiftieth year of the pastorate of Carr’s
Lane Chapel, by the late Rev. J. A. James. He laid the
foundation stone 11th September, 1855.</p>

<p>The Congregationalists have also chapels in Gooch
Street, Moseley Road, St. Andrew’s Road, Saltley, Small
Heath, Parade (Tabernacle), and Winson Green Road,
and several others outside the Borough, but in immediate
proximity to it..</p>

<p><b>Society of Friends.</b>&mdash;George Fox records in his
journal that he held a meeting in Birmingham in the
year 1655, and there is good reason to believe in the
existence of a small society from that date, meeting in
private houses until 1703, when a plain brick meeting
house fronting Bull Street was built. There may have
been an earlier meeting house in Monmouth Street, where
there was a burial ground, acquired in 1851 by the Great
Western Railway, and now the site of the Arcade. The
meeting house in Bull Street was several times enlarged,
and in 1856 it was pulled down, shops built fronting the
street, and a more commodious meeting house built in
the rear. There is also another meeting place in Bath
Row. Meetings for religious worship and instruction,
conducted by members of the Society, are held on
Sundays at Severn Street Schools, and the Board Schools
in Moseley Street and Bristol Street. The Early First-Day
Morning School, and the other schools and classes
at Severn Street, established by the Friends, have done,
and are doing an incalculable amount of good.</p>

<p><b>Wesleyan Methodists.</b>&mdash;John Wesley preached
his first sermon in Birmingham in 1743, but it was not
until 1764 that his followers acquired an old play hou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>se
in Moor Street as their first chapel which he opened. In
1782 they had so prospered as to build a chapel in Cherry
Street, which was opened by John Wesley himself, then
in his eightieth year. This chapel, enlarged in the year
1823, is now (July, 1886) to be pulled down, and a new
chapel built in Corporation Street.</p>

<p>The rapid increase of numbers necessitated additional
chapels in Bradford Street (1786), <span class="smcap">Belmont Row</span>
(1789), <span class="smcap">Martin Street</span>, (Broad Street) (1834), <span class="smcap">Newtown
Row Chapel</span> (1837), <span class="smcap">Wesley Chapel</span>, Constitution
Hill (1838), besides a chapel in Bell Barn Road for
which the present <span class="smcap">Bristol Road Chapel</span> (1854) was
substituted.</p>

<p>For the purposes of connexional organization the
Birmingham district is divided into seven circuits, which
include not only the chapels already mentioned but also
thirty-three others within the Borough and its suburbs,
including Smethwick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Methodist New Connexion.</span>&mdash;This section of the
Methodist Community, which separated from the Wesleyans
in 1797, only on questions of the share of the laity
in church government, first built a chapel in Oxford Street
(1811) now disused, then another in the northern part of
the town, Unett Street (1838), and have since built
smaller ones in Moseley Street, Priestley Road (Stratford
Road) Ladywood, Heath Street and Crabtree Road
(Brookfields) in the Borough. These and a chapel at
Smethwick are divided into two circuits supplied by three
circuit ministers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Primitive Methodists.</span>&mdash;This body has thirteen
chapels in and near to the Borough, divided into three
circuits, and served by four regular ministers. The
largest of these is in Gooch Street, and the others in the
Borough are in Sparkbrook, King Street, Lord Street,
Nechells, Garrison Lane, Whitmore Street (Hockley) and
Ladywood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The United Methodist Free Churches</span> have
two circuits and two circuit ministers and chapels in
Rocky Lane (Nechells) Bond Street, (recently acquired
from the Baptists, <i>q.v.</i>) and Muntz Street (Bir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>mingham
Heath) besides one at Washwood Heath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Wesleyan Reformers.</span>&mdash;Have one regular
minister and two chapels in Upper Trinity Street and
Floodgate Street.</p>

<p><b>The English Presbyterian Church.</b>&mdash;These are
the orthodox Presbyterians, as distinguished from the
churches which, like the Old Meeting congregation, became
Arian or Unitarian. They first occupied what is now the
Baptist Chapel at Mount Zion, which was opened by the
celebrated Edward Irving (see Baptists), and then a
chapel in Newhall Street, afterwards the church in <span class="smcap">Broad
Street</span>, which is their principal edifice. They have also
churches at Camp Hill and New John Street West.</p>

<p><b>The Christian Brethren</b> have a head place of
worship at the Central Hall, Great Charles Street, and
other meeting places in Green Lane (Small Heath), New
John Street West, Camp Hill, and Icknield Port Road in
the Borough, and four others in the outskirts.</p>

<p>Several other religious bodies have only one or two
places of worship, and among these may be named&mdash;</p>

<p><b>The Bloomsbury Institution</b> Mission Hall, in
Bloomsbury Street.</p>

<p><b>The Boatmen’s Hall</b> in Bridge Street (Broad Street).</p>

<p><b>The Catholic Apostolic Church</b>, in Summer Hill
Terrace, a new church built by the congregation formerly
assembling at what was called the Irvingite Church, in
Newhall Street.</p>

<p><b>The Christadelphians</b>, who meet in the Temperance
Hall, in Temple Street.</p>

<p><b>The Church of the Saviour</b>, in Edward Street
(Parade), built in 1847 for Mr. George Dawson, M.A.,
on his leaving the Mount Zion (Baptists) Chapel (<i>q.v.</i>).
A free church, founded on the principle that common
Christian worship and pursuit of religious truth, and not
doctrinal agreement, are the true bases of Christian union.</p>

<p><b>The Jewish Synagogue</b>, in Blucher Street, top of
Severn Street, was built in 1856, to supply the place of a
smaller synagogue in Severn Street. It cost upwards of
£8,000.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The New Church</b>, or Swedenborgians, had for their
first chapel the one in Newhall Street (now occupied by
the Baptists, <i>q.v.</i>) then, in 1830, removed to a new chapel
in Summer Lane, and subsequently, in 1875, to an elegant
church, a little way over the Borough boundary, in Wretham
Road (Soho Hill).</p>

<p><b>The Welsh Calvinistic Methodists</b>, who have a
chapel in Granville Street (Bath Row), and another in
Hockley Hill, just over the Borough boundary.</p>

<p><b>The Welsh Congregationalists</b> have a chapel in
Wheeler Street.</p>

<p><b>Roman Catholics.</b>&mdash;There is no record of any
Roman Catholic place of worship in Birmingham from the
Reformation until the publication, by James the Second,
of the illegal Declaration of Indulgence in 1687. In that
year the foundation of a church and convent, dedicated
to St. Mary Magdalene, was laid near the street still called
Masshouse Lane, and probably on the site of the present
Church of St. Bartholomew (<i>q.v.</i>). It was scarcely built
when it was pulled down at the Revolution of 1688. The
priests (who were of the order of St. Francis) removed
to a farm house in a lane near Harborne, the approach
to which, at the top of Richmond Hill Road, Edgbaston,
was known as Masshouse Lane.</p>

<p>The first chapel in the town was the one dedicated to
<span class="smcap">St. Peter</span>, in St. Peter’s Place, a little way out of Broad
Street, built in 1786, and a burial ground and schools
added and subsequently enlarged.</p>

<p>The next was a chapel in Shadwell Street, built in 1809,
and dedicated to St. Chad, which afterwards gave place to
<span class="smcap">St. Chad’s Cathedral</span>, Bath Street, built after the
designs of A. Welby Pugin at a cost of £60,000, and
consecrated June 22, 1841.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Anne’s</span>, Alcester Street, was originally a distillery, and
was acquired by the Fathers of the Oratory of St. Philip
Neri, of whom John Henry (now Cardinal) Newman was
one. In 1852, the Fathers removed to the Hagley Road
(<i>q.v.</i>), and St. Anne’s became a secular mission.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Church of the Immaculate Conception</span>, Hagley
Road, Edgbaston. Here, in addition to the Church, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> a
residence for the Fathers of the Order of St. Philip Neri,
and a school for the education of the sons of the Catholic
gentry. It is interesting to every educated man as having
been for more than a quarter of a century the abode of
John Henry (Cardinal) Newman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Michael’s</span>, Moor Street, formerly the New Meeting
House of the Unitarians (<i>q.v.</i>), and purchased from that
body in 1861, and opened in 1862.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Joseph’s</span>, Nechells, formerly only a chapel of the
cemetery there served from St. Chad’s, became a church
with two priests in the year 1872.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Catherine of Sienna</span> in the Horse Fair was
consecrated September 28, 1875, and</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Patrick’s</span> in the Dudley Road was opened in 1876.</p>

<p>Birmingham is one of the Roman Catholic Sees created
by the celebrated Papal-Decree of 29th September, 1850.
To that date from 1584, when the last of the old Roman
Catholic Prelates died, the English Romanists had been
governed in matters ecclesiastical by Vicars-Apostolic, of
whom the last and best known was Bishop (<i>in partibus</i>)
afterwards Cardinal Wiseman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After this enumeration of the numerous churches and
chapels, which the limited number of pages at the writer’s
disposal necessarily reduces to almost a catalogue, it may
be useful to summarise the general results of the religious
life of the town.</p>

<p>It must never be forgotten that every church and chapel
is a centre of educational and philanthropic work of many
kinds. The clergy of the established church have almost
a monopoly of day schools, whilst the various denominations
of dissenters for the most part leave the education
of the poor to the Board schools. Night schools are
common to both churches and chapels&mdash;Sunday schools
are universally attached to both. Then there are the
auxiliary organisations of Bible Classes, Lending Libraries,
Provident Societies, Sick Clubs, Saving Clubs, Clothing
Clubs, Improvement Societies, Mothers’ Meetings, Dorcas
Societies, Lectures on Health and Domestic Economy by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
ladies, and, attached to some churches and chapels, classes
for instruction in elementary Science and Literature.</p>

<p>Of the three parties into which the established church
is commonly divided, viz., Low, High, and Broad, the
general tone of the Birmingham clergy for the last fifty
years has been decidedly low. A glance at the table will
shew that the rights of presentation to the mother church
of St. Martin and the other three rectories of All Saints,
St. George, and St. Thomas, and also to many of the
newly-created vicarages, are vested in trustees. With the
exception of two or three of the new churches, such as
those of St. Alban the Martyr, and the Oldknow Memorial
Church, these trustees have been of the type of the
Simeon Trustees.</p>

<p>For many years Holy Trinity, Bordesley, was the sole
representative of High Church ritual and doctrine, both
of which have made great progress the last quarter of a
century, and at many of the churches the services are
distinctly “higher” than formerly. The same influences
have been at work among Nonconformists. The old
pattern of meetinghouse has given place everywhere to a
more ecclesiastical style, and even where the structure
cannot be altered, the walls are coloured and decorated.
The congregational plain song of half a century ago is
varied and improved by chanting and anthems, and in one
Nonconformist Church may be seen a surpliced choir.</p>

<p>The “Broad” Church party is scarcely represented in
Birmingham, and with the exceptions of the Head Master
and some of the other Masters of the Free Grammar
School, and the Rector of St. Martin’s, who, from his
position, is naturally a representative man, the Birmingham
clergy do not concern themselves much with either the
political, municipal, scientific, or literary pursuits of their
fellow townsmen. They have the good reason that the
work of their parishes makes such demands upon them
that they have neither time nor strength for any other
labours. Hence the public work of the town (with the
exception of the School Board, on which the clergy have
been always strongly represented) has for the last fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>y
years been more influenced by the leading Nonconformist
ministers than by the clergy.</p>

<p>Whilst the religious activity of the Nonconformists has
not abated, they have gained immensely in influence in
all the governing bodies and public institutions. For
example, for a century previous to the year 1873, no
dissenter had been elected a Governor of the Free Grammar
School; now there are nine Nonconformists out of
the twenty-one Governors. The religious activity of the
Church has been widened and deepened by the development
of the parochial system, whilst the natural “set” of
nonconformist activity towards political and social reforms
has won for them the control of political and municipal
affairs. This cannot be better illustrated than by a few
particulars of the composition of the Birmingham Town
Council, which has acquired the reputation of being above
the average of Town Councils in the social standing and
ability of its members. Of the sixty-four members of
which the Town Council is composed, seventeen only are
churchmen. Of the sixteen Aldermen (assumed to be
elected by the Council on account of services either
exceptional in kind or duration) only one is a churchman.
The forty-seven members of the Council not belonging to
the Established Church, are composed of six Baptists,
nine Congregationalists, six members of the Society of
Friends, one Jew, one Presbyterian, two Roman Catholics,
nine Unitarians, six Undenominational, and seven members
of the Wesleyan and other Methodist bodies. The preponderance
of Quakers and Unitarians in the Council, in
proportion to their numerical strength in the country, is
very remarkable. The number of members of the Society
of Friends in England and Wales, is about one to every
1,725 of the population, according to the census of 1881.
The number of their members and attendants on their
services in Birmingham, is about one to every 527 of
the population of the Borough; whilst in the Council
their numbers are nearly one in ten (accurately 9.375 per
cent.) or more than fifty times their numerical proportion.
It is not possible to determine so accurately the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of Unitarians, but it may be safely asserted that their
representation in the Council is many times in excess
of <i>their</i> numerical proportion.</p>

<h4>BURIAL GROUNDS AND CEMETERIES.</h4>

<p>Most of the Churches built in Birmingham up to the
year 1834 had churchyards added to them. The Churchyard
of St. Martin being found inadequate, nearly three
acres of land in Park Street was consecrated in the year
1813 as a burial ground, and have been since laid out as a
public garden (see St. Bartholomew). There were burial
grounds attached to the Old Meeting, to the Baptist
Chapel, Cannon Street, and to the Friends Meeting
House; there was also a piece of ground in Walmer
Lane, appropriated by a Congregationalist, Joseph Scott,
for the burial of Protestant Dissenters (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1779). There
were also burial grounds for the Jewish Community in a
spot called the Froggery, now part of New Street Station, in
Granville Street and Betholom Row.</p>

<p>In 1832, a joint stock company was formed for constructing
the General Cemetery at Key Hill&mdash;the area of
which is about twelve acres. Divided from it by Pitsford
Street is the Church of England Cemetery, consecrated
in 1848. In 1850 the Catholic Cemetery of St. Joseph
was established.</p>

<p>By successive orders in Council most of the intra-mural
burial grounds were closed, and in the year 1860 the
Corporation purchased 105 acres of land at Witton for
a Borough Cemetery. Of this area, fifty-three acres are
consecrated for use by members of the Established Church;
thirty-five are set apart for Nonconformists, two acres and
a half have been sold for the use of the Hebrew Community,
and the residue is appropriated for the use of
Roman Catholics. There are four distinct buildings for
the use of the Church of England, Roman Catholics,
Nonconformists, and Jews. To this Cemetery the coffins
from Scott’s burial ground (72), Cannon Street Chapel
(142), and the Old Meeting House (1503), have been
removed.</p>

ART.</h3>

<p><b>Architecture.</b>&mdash;[By <span class="smcap">J. A. Cossins.</span>]&mdash;Although
anciently possessing a Church, a Priory and a Castle,
Birmingham now retains hardly a vestige of the work of
the builders of the middle ages. When the old Parish
Church of St. Martin was pulled down in 1872 to make
way for its very fine successor, the indications of its
history, hidden for nearly two centuries by a casing of
brickwork, were revealed: traces were found of the work
of the 12th and 13th centuries, and considerable remains
of what must have been a fine building, mainly of the
14th century. The altar tombs, with effigies of the
Lords de Birmingham, were carefully preserved and refixed
in the new Church, and are well worthy of examination.<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>A few houses of the framed timber and plaster construction
common in the 17th century, remain in Digbeth,
and one of a very interesting kind was this year removed
from the corner of Bull Street. The earliest in date is
the Old Crown House, which is probably of the first half
of the 16th century. This was a very interesting
specimen of the more massively constructed, but simpler
kind, with gables at the extremities of the front, and a
central porch of two stories; but the whole of the ground
floor was reconstructed about twenty years ago, and it has
recently been further disfigured by painting and graining.
At Camp Hill there is a very fine half-timbered house in
good preservation. This has the date 1601 cut on the
porch. Most of the houses burnt by Prince Rupert,
when he sacked the town in 1643, were probably of the
half-timbered kind, since several still remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Philip’s Church.</span>&mdash;From this time there is
nothing to mark the architectural progress of the town
until the important event of the making by Act of Parliament,
passed in 1711, of a new parish of St. Philip in
Birmingham. This was immediately followed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
building of the Church of St. Philip, a remarkably good
example of the School of English Renaissance founded
by Wren and continued by his pupils, of whom the
architect of this Church, Thomas Archer, was one of the
most successful. The first stone of the Church was
laid in 1711, and it was consecrated in 1715. It is a
large building, the area divided into nave and aisles by
square, fluted pillars, carrying semicircular arches, and
supporting galleries which extend over the aisles. With
the exception of the steeple, the whole has been restored,
and within the last year the chancel, which was but a
shallow recess, has been lengthened by one bay. The fine
east window by Mr. Burne Jones, a native of Birmingham,
is considered to be one of his most successful works.</p>

<p>The building of the Church was soon followed by the
erection of rows of houses of an uniform character on the
north and south sides of the churchyard. These have
nearly all disappeared: they were built of brick in the
good domestic style of the early part of the last century,
with picturesque doorways, with curved and broken
pediments, balustraded parapets, and heavy white sashes
with broad moulded frames. The interiors had fine oak
staircases with turned and twisted balusters, and were
good examples of the cheery home-like dwellings of their
time. Other buildings, forming “The Old Square,” of a
somewhat similar character, have lately been pulled down
to make way for a new street, and very little that is even
as old as the “Georges” will be left us after a very short
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Town Hall.</span>&mdash;The building of the Town Hall,
begun in 1832, was the first great local architectural event
of the present century. It was designed by Messrs.
Hansom &amp; Welch, architects, of Liverpool, in professed
imitation of the Corinthian Temple of Jupiter Stator at
Rome, but it falls far below its prototype in the scale and
richness of the “order.” To properly adapt a temple of
the Romans to the various wants and requirements of a
Town Hall for the people of Birmingham required considerable
inventive skill, and to obtain the required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
height the temple was mounted on a lofty rusticated
basement. The grand flights of steps to the colonnades,
which add so much dignity to the Greek and Roman
temples, are here accessible only by means of a ladder. It
is nevertheless a noble building, of Anglesey marble,
though what we admire in the exterior is due to the
ancient architect, and not to the adapters. The interior
is well suited to its many and varied uses, but the
entrances are narrow and undignified, and the lobbies
insufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Free Grammar School</span>, or King Edward’s
School, was founded on the property belonging to the
Gild of the Holy Cross, taken possession of by
Henry VIII., and restored to the town by Edward VI. in
the shape of an educational endowment. The old hall
used by the Gild stood on the site of the present school,
and it is probable that it was used as a school until new
buildings were erected in 1707. Of that edifice drawings
are in existence, which show it to have been of two
storeys, and forming three sides of a quadrangle, with a
tower over the central and chief entrance, terminated by
a cupola. The buildings were of brick, with stone
dressings; the windows square-headed, of the heavy-sashed
description used in the domestic architecture of the time.
A high balustraded parapet hid the roofs from sight.</p>

<p>The School was pulled down in 1832, and the present
noble building erected on its site. The style is that of
the latter half of the fifteenth century, commonly called
Tudor, and although erected so soon after the revival of
Gothic architecture, it has scarcely been excelled for
boldness and propriety of design or for purity of detail.
It forms on plan a nearly equal-sided square. The chief
front, facing New Street, has slightly projecting wings, in
which are fine Oriel windows, of two stories, the intermediate
length being divided by boldly projecting
buttresses, terminated by crocketed pinnacles, into nine
bays of two stories in height. The entrance is in the
middle bay, through a handsome moulded and carved
doorway, to a vestibule finely groined in stone. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>The
upper floor of the central part of the front is now occupied
by the Girls’ School, and is lighted by grand traceried
and transomed windows of three lights. The south front,
looking towards the railway station, contains the Boys’
School, and is of a simpler, but quite as good a design
as the main elevation. The two principal schoolrooms
are very fine, with open timber roofs. The architect was
Sir Charles Barry, and a striking similarity between the
details of this building and of those of the Houses of
Parliament of about this time may be observed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christ Church.</span>&mdash;Christ Church, consecrated in 1813,
stands at the junction of New Street with Ann Street,
and occupies the most prominent and the best position
in the town, but is quite unworthy of its site. It
is in the quasi-Classic style prevailing in the time of
George III., with a lofty but ill-proportioned tower and
spire, and a western portico of the Roman Doric order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Peter’s.</span>&mdash;Several of the churches succeeding the
last were built by the well known Thomas Rickman;
among these were St. Peter’s in Dale End, a heavy,
uninteresting building, with a Grecian Doric portico,
surmounted by a “Temple-of-the-Winds”-like structure as
a steeple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Thomas’s.</span>&mdash;St. Thomas’s, at Holloway Head,
another of Rickman’s, is designed in the same spirit, but
with details of the Ionic order. Some of the earliest
efforts of the revival of Gothic architecture were made
here by Rickman, the most important of which,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. George’s</span>, a large perpendicular structure, is for
its time fairly good, but the details are thin and wiry.</p>

<p>A number of cheap churches followed in the first half
of the present century, none of them deserving of notice;
but some better things were being done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Chad’s.</span>&mdash;The Roman Catholic Cathedral Church
of St. Chad, in Bath Street, by the elder Pugin, though
in some parts bare and mean from want of funds, shews
the genius of the architect in its plan, its imposing interior,
and its fine western front.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>Of the churches of quite modern date, we have first the
rebuilt Mother Church of St. Martin before referred to.
The tower was re-cased and the spire rebuilt in 1854-5,
and in 1873-5 the present building was erected by
Mr. J. A. Chatwin, architect, of Birmingham, and completed
in 1875, at a cost of £28,256. The style is
Gothic, as it had become perfected in the middle of the
14th century, and it has been used by the architect with
great skill and judgment. The interior is exceedingly
fine, and the exterior not unworthy of it. Preserved in
the north and south chapels at the east end, are the fine
sepulchral monuments of the Lords de Birmingham. It
has excellent stained glass windows by Wm. Morris,
Hardman, and others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Augustine’s</span> and the <span class="smcap">Lea Memorial Church</span>,
both at Edgbaston, are also fine churches by the same
architect. The noble spire of the former is a conspicuous
and beautiful object from a large extent of country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aston Church</span> has lately been rebuilt by Mr. Chatwin,
with the exception of the tower and spire, at a cost of
£15,000. The church contains many monuments of the
Erdingtons, Ardens, Holts, Devereux, and other Warwickshire
families. The very beautiful tower and spire
are of the 15th century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handsworth Parish Church</span> has also been rebuilt
by the same architect, with the exception of the tower
and the “Watt Chapel.” Besides the monument by
Chantry to James Watt, there are interesting monuments
to Boulton, Murdock, and other local celebrities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Church of St. Alban</span>, in Conybere Street, lately
erected by Mr. Hansom, of London, in the style of the
13th century, has an extremely fine interior, groined
throughout with stone. The tower and spire are unfinished.</p>

<p>Another good church by the same architect, is that of
<span class="smcap">St. Catherine</span> (R. C.) in the Horse Fair, also with unfinished
tower and spire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dissenting Congregations</span> have some noteworthy
buildings. Amongst those of the Unitarians, the
Church of the Messiah, in Broad Street, by Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>Bateman,
and the “Old Meeting Trust” Church, in the Bristol Road,
lately erected by Mr. J. A. Cossins, are the most important.
The Baptists have two handsome churches, the Church of
the Redeemer, in Hagley Road, by Cubitt, of London, and
Wycliffe Church, by the late Mr. Cranston, in Bristol
Street. The Catholic Apostolic Church of the Irvingites,
in the “Sand Pits,” is a bold building of brick and terra
cotta, with a noble nave, by Mr. Chatwin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Municipal Buildings</span> of the town, with the
exception of the Town Hall, are nearly all of quite
recent construction. First among these is the Council
House in Colmore Row, near the top of New Street.
This noble and commodious building was opened in 1878,
and comprises a grand suite of reception rooms, a fine
Council Chamber, semicircular on plan, offices for the
Mayor, Town Clerk, Surveyor, Treasurer, Chief of Police
and other officers, and a large number of committee
rooms. The approaches, staircases and corridors are all
handsome and spacious. The fronts are constructed of
Derbyshire stone in the Italian style, the principal
elevation towards Colmore Row consisting of an imposing
centre, with <i>porte-cocher</i>, and wings. The tympanums of
the pediments are filled with groups of sculpture, and
the large arch over the portico contains some fine work in
Mosaic by Salviati. The architect was Mr. Yeoville
Thomason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art Gallery.</span>&mdash;Adjoining the Council House, is the
Art Gallery, by the same architect, which forms with it
one block of buildings surrounding a quadrangle. This
was opened last year, and is a series of galleries probably
not excelled by any in England. The principal feature of
the interior is a vast domed circular room, from which
the other rooms are entered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Parochial Offices</span>, in Edmund and Newhall
Streets, by Mr. Ward, form a large and handsome block,
containing the offices of the Poor Law Guardians, the
Superintendent Registrar of Births, Deaths and
Marriages, &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Galleries of the Society of Artists</span>, New
Street.&mdash;The principal room is circular, 52 feet in
diameter, and there are several other rooms, which, with
the fine Corinthian Portico, were completed in 1829.
They have since been much improved and enlarged, and
now form a very excellent set of galleries.</p>

<p>To describe properly the Educational Buildings of the
town would require a volume; a few only of the
principal ones can be noticed. The Grammar School,
the oldest of them, has already been referred to. The
Mason College, founded by the late Sir Josiah Mason, is
a fine building of brick and stone in Edmund street, the
first stone of which was laid in 1875, and the building
opened in October, 1880. This institution comprises
large and complete Laboratories for Chemistry, Physics,
Physiology, Botany, and Engineering; four Lecture
Theatres, and a very great number of class and other
rooms of all sizes, suited to their varied requirements,
the whole covering an area of about 2,500 square yards.
The style of Architecture is that of the 13th century.
The principal front in Edmund Street, of about 150 feet
in length, is symmetrically arranged with a lofty centre and
gabled side wings. The principal entrance in the middle
of the front is a very large and deeply recessed moulded
and shafted archway opening to a fine groined vestibule,
the cross passages leading from which are also groined in
stone. Over the entrance is a lofty double oriel beneath
a gable, the terminal of which is a mermaid (the crest of
Sir Josiah Mason), 122 feet from the pavement. The
cost was about £60,000, including the elaborate and
costly fittings of the laboratories. The whole of the
buildings and fittings were designed by Mr. Jethro A.
Cossins, Architect, of Birmingham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Birmingham and Midland Institute</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Free Libraries</span> form one united group. The Institute
buildings, by Mr. Edward Barry, were opened in 1856 by
the Prince Consort. The completion of the design to
receive the Reference and Lending Libraries was carried
out by Messrs. Martin and Chamberlain; the whole has
since been largely added to, the Lending and Referen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>ce
Libraries have been rebuilt, and a new wing erected in
Paradise Street, by the same architects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The School of Art</span>, also by Martin &amp; Chamberlain,
in Edmund Street, is in the very original modern Gothic
style, almost created by the late J. H. Chamberlain, and
practised with such great success by the firm to which he
belonged. The School is perhaps the finest of their
works, and possesses a rare grace and refinement in every
detail. The arrangements for the convenience of masters
and students are also excellent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Board Schools.</span>&mdash;Since the passing of the Elementary
Education Act, in 1870, about thirty large Board Schools
have been erected in the town, most of them by Messrs.
Martin and Chamberlain, they are nearly all of great
excellence and are ornaments to the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Exchange</span>, in Stephenson Place, was built in
1865, by Mr. Edward Holmes, architect, of Birmingham,
and has since been considerably enlarged. It has a large
exchange room on the ground floor, over a part of which
is a room for assemblies. The building also contains a
Restaurant, shops on the ground floor, and a large number
of offices. The fronts, towards Stephenson Place and
New Street, in a Gothic style, are lofty and imposing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The “Arcades”</span> are a feature of modern Birmingham.
The Great Western Arcade was built in 1876, at a cost of
£70,000. Mr. W. H. Ward, of Birmingham, was the
architect. The avenue, four hundred feet long, has eighty-four
shops on two stories, the upper tier opening to a
balcony. The length is divided equally by a circular
space covered by a lofty dome. The glazed roof is carried
by a series of semicircular arches, the perspective effect of
which is very striking.</p>

<p>In an almost straight line with the last, and only
divided from it by the width of a street, is the North
Western Arcade, by Mr. W. Jenkins. In its general
features it is much like the first, but of greater width, and
the shops are larger.</p>

<p>It may be added that these arcades have been
financially a great success, and are much us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>ed as a
convenient and pleasant thoroughfare from the Great
Western Station to Corporation Street.</p>

<p>There are several other arcades in the town, some of
which are worthy of a visit.</p>

<p>Until the passing of the Street Improvement Act of
1876, Birmingham had but very few streets that were
worthy of the size and importance of the town. New
Street is, however, a fine and picturesque thoroughfare,
the slight rise and easy curve contributing very much to
the general effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corporation Street</span>, leading from New Street,
opposite the entrance to the Railway Station, to the Aston
Road, has been but lately formed; it is not yet entirely
finished, but is already an unusually fine street. Many of
the buildings are of great height and costliness. It
promises to be one of the noblest thoroughfares to be
found in any of our great towns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aston Hall.</span>&mdash;Sir Thomas Holte, whose family had
long been resident at Duddeston, in the parish of Aston,
began to build this magnificent house in 1618, and in
1631 he came to reside in it. In 1864 it was purchased
by the Corporation of Birmingham, together with forty-three
acres of the once extensive park, immediately
surrounding it, and in the same year it was thrown open to
the public. Dugdale, who wrote whilst the Hall was fresh
from the hands of the builders, calls it “a noble fabric,
which for beauty and state much exceedeth any in these
parts,” and the same may yet be said of it. It is well
situated on high ground at a distance of about two miles
from Stephenson Place, and retains about it some of the
grand old chestnut and other trees for which the park was
famous. Most of the outbuildings, including the stables,
houses of the Chief Falconer and other officers, and the chief
entrance lodge also remain, and add much to the interest
and general effect. The principal front, approached by
what remains of the Chestnut Tree Avenue, is symmetrically
arranged, and consists of a central block with wings
of considerable projection, enclosing a court of which one
side is open to the East. The chief entrance door in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
middle of the front is under a square tower furnished with
a lofty ogee curved roof, each of the wings has also a door
from the court, under a similar tower. The towers, the
curved gables, and the lofty bay windows which terminate
the wings, combine in producing an extremely picturesque
and imposing effect. The windows are all square headed
and mullioned, the walling is of thin bricks, with windows,
doors, and other important details of stone.</p>

<p>The entrance hall is fine and lofty, and the principal
staircase with massive square newels and scroll work
balustrade is extremely rich in effect. The great drawing
room, the dining room, Lady Holte’s room, and the great
gallery, 136 feet long, are all grand apartments with
elaborate ceilings in intricate geometrical patterns, rich
cornices, and magnificent chimney pieces. Besides those
mentioned, there are a great number of rooms of less
importance. Many of the principal apartments contain
collections of great interest.</p>

<p><b>Painting.</b>&mdash;[By <span class="smcap">E. R. Taylor</span>.]&mdash;For the opening
of the Corporation Art Gallery in November, 1885, the
large room was filled with a loan collection of pictures by
Mr. G. F. Watts, R.A., and Mr. E. Burne Jones, A.R.A.
These works, together with others of a decorative
character, belonging to the town, have enabled the
Birmingham public to view, for the first time, the highest
phases of English Art.</p>

<p>The history of Art proves that, when the nobler walks
of Painting and Sculpture reach a high standard of
execution, decorative character, and poetic insight, Art,
as applied to manufactures, makes corresponding progress.
Decorative and poetic art in painting as seen in the works
of Leighton, Watts, Burne Jones, Rossetti, Mason,
Richmond, Albert Moore, Walter Crane, and others is,
therefore, of special interest to a manufacturing town like
Birmingham. So long as these men exhibit the possibilities
of decorative art, their work must be fraught with good
to those engaged in applying similar principles to art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
manufactures, and (what is of equal importance) must
educate those who are to be users of art productions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birmingham Artists.</span>&mdash;The names of at least two
Birmingham men will ever hold a prominent place in the
annals of English Art,&mdash;David Cox and E. Burne Jones;
and as, from his residence here and his being a member
of the Royal Society of Artists in this town, George
Mason may also be fairly considered a local man,
Birmingham may be said to have produced three great
Masters&mdash;each perhaps the highest in his particular
branch&mdash;in the three most characteristic phases and
developments of English Art. Of this the town may be
justly proud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David Cox.</span>&mdash;David Cox was born in Birmingham in
1783. His birth-place was near to “The Old Crown,” a
noted ancient timbered house in Deritend. He received
his early art instruction from Joseph Barber, who conducted
an academy close to the site of the present
Municipal School of Art. In the mastership of that
academy, Joseph Barber was succeeded by his son,
J. Vincent Barber. A few doors away, Samuel Lines
carried on a drawing school. These were the only means
of art instruction in the town until the formation of the
Society of Arts, whose work is now continued in the
above-mentioned Municipal School. Cox was apprenticed
for eighteen months to a miniature painter on lockets and
snuff boxes. Owing to the bankruptcy of his master,
his engagement was terminated at the end of that period.
He afterwards became scene painter at the Birmingham
Theatre, then under the management of the elder
Macready. John Varley, the famous water-colour painter,
and Müller also gave him a few lessons in water-colours
and oils, respectively. Thus Cox received what was for
his day a fairly good education in art, if in this we include
his initiation first into miniature painting and then into
scene painting.</p>

<p>In 1813 he was elected a member of the Society of
Painters in Water Colours. During his whole career, he
seems to have possessed a strong affection for his nat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>ive
place; and, as soon as he was freed from the worries
and anxieties of teaching, he came to Greenfield House,
Harborne, where he spent the last eighteen years of his
life, working at his beloved art, and paying visits, from
time to time, to favourite Bettws-y-Coed. He died in
1859.</p>

<p>Cox was contemporary with Constable and Crowe.
All three received but slight recognition of their merits
while living; but since death their work has been highly
praised and much sought after. Yet these men&mdash;and
Cox particularly&mdash;were the first to carry out that direct
study from nature which has become the characteristic of
the English school, as distinct from the studio compositions
and artificialities which flourished from the time
of Claude to their own. There is every probability that
the love for English scenery&mdash;scenery so full of colour
and character; so varied and so changeful&mdash;has been
greatly stimulated amongst the people by the fact that
these artists have portrayed its beauties in their paintings,
and have thus instilled a perception of, and love for, these
beauties in nature.</p>

<p>Of the works of Cox, the Art Gallery contains thirty-three
oil paintings (the Nettlefold Bequest), and two or
three water-colours. This is perhaps the finest collection
of his oil colours extant, and among it may be specially
mentioned: “Sheep Shearing” (27) and “Driving
Cattle” (28), both full in colour, and simple and direct in
execution; while “Changing Pasture” (9) may be cited
as one of his best works. In the picture last mentioned,
the sunset sky, the purplish blue distance, and the truth
of the light in the middle distance and foreground should
receive particular attention. “In the Hayfield” (26) is
more in his water-colour manner; as is also his grand
“Rhyl Sands” (10), in which the effect of the sea breeze
is felt all over the picture. “Bettws Church” (11),
“Tending Sheep, Bettws-y-Coed” (12), and “Evening”
(24) are excellent examples of that quiet and unaffected,
yet highly poetic treatment by which he ennobled the
simplest materials; while “The Shrimpers” (31) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
perhaps the best of his pictures of a sandy shore. “The
Missing Lamb” (2) is interesting, in that it shows his
method of commencing work. “Asking the Way” (40)
is a fine example of his water-colours. In the midst of
these beautiful specimens of Cox’s labour is placed “The
Late David Cox” (17), by Sir John Watson Gordon&mdash;one
of the most successful portraits of a great artist by a
brother artist. Alike by its success and the evident
sympathy between painter and subject, the work recalls
the portrait of Hook by Sir J. E. Millais.</p>

<p>Whilst a careful study of Cox’s life and pictures, of his
earnest and loving methods of work, and of the glorious
harvest therefrom resulting, has had a highly beneficial
effect on the world of Art, there is no doubt that from the
sudden rise in value of his pictures, and the consequent
magnifying of any scrap of paper his hand had touched,
as well as from the fact that the work of his latest and
broadest style was most accessible, a certain servile
imitation of his mannerisms, supplanted the earnest and
loving study of nature, which characterised Cox to the
end. These mannerisms, which by long study he had
earned the right to use, and which in his work were
always full of meaning, too often became in the productions
of his imitators meaningless and pretentious.
Time, however, is curing this evil; and the good alone
will remain. As an example of the enormous increase in
the monetary value of his pictures, it may be stated that
“Lancaster sands,” for which Cox received £10, was sold
at the Gillott sale for 3,000 guineas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Mason.</span>&mdash;The work of George Mason, A.R.A.
(born 1818; died 1872), marks a further development of
English Art. He, like Frederick Walker, opened up still
deeper poetic sympathies for us. During the varied
phases of humanity, its toil and its rest, were no longer
treated as mere accessories to the landscape, but as a
large and essential part of it; not inserted to give a point,
or story, or bit of colour to the picture, but intended from
the beginning to essentially form a part of its growth as a
work of art. And even when there is no human incident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
poetically treated, as in his “Evening Hymn,” or
“Harvest Moon,” there is something in his schemes of
colour or other treatment of his landscape which occurs
to awaken a human interest never reached even by Cox
or Turner. This school has had the strongest and widest
influence on the English Art of to-day. It is greatly to be
regretted that the Birmingham Art Gallery contains no
examples of the works of George Mason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. Burne Jones.</span>&mdash;The third phase is that represented
by Mr. E. Burne Jones and Mr. Watts. This
being the most recent development, its force cannot yet
be measured; but there is little doubt that it will be the
greatest of the three. For six months after the opening
of the gallery, one end of the large room aforesaid was
filled with a magnificent collection of the works of Mr.
Burne Jones; and at a recent exhibition of the Birmingham
Society of Artists, was shewn his noblest work, “The
Six Days of Creation.”</p>

<p>The sale of the Graham collection has dispersed most
of these. Perhaps no previous sale had evoked so much
interest,&mdash;not even that of the Gillott collection. The
enthusiasm then evinced, as well as the large prices
obtained, shew that the work of the artist is already
receiving just recognition. In addition to “The Six
Days of Creation,” there were (<i>e.g.</i>) exhibited at Birmingham
“Le Chant d’Amour,” “Venus’s Mirror,” “The
Beguiling of Merlin,” “Love in the Ruins,” “Love
Disguised as Reason,” but as these are no longer here, it
is unnecessary now to describe them. “The Feast of
Peleus” has been lent by its fortunate possessor, Mr.
Alderman Kenrick, M.P. This picture&mdash;at least from
an artist’s point of view&mdash;is one of the painter’s most
beautiful works. At the marriage of Peleus and Thetis,
the Goddess of Discord throws down a golden apple,
to be claimed by the most beautiful. Juno, Venus,
and Minerva rise eagerly to claim it. In the foreground
are three fates. The composition, drawing,
scheme of colour, and marvellous realization even of the
minutest details of form and colour render this work one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of exceptionally high character, and, taken as a whole,
the most enjoyable of all the artist’s productions.</p>

<p>Attention may also be here directed to the fact that
there have been placed in St. Martin’s and St. Philip’s
Churches, Birmingham, two lovely stained glass windows,
both designed by Mr. Burne Jones. The artist’s practice
in stained glass, tempera, and mosaic has, no doubt,
greatly influenced his style of composition and colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Municipal Gallery.</span>&mdash;Pictures by the following
Birmingham artists, named alphabetically, belong to the

</div>

<p>One other name should be included in any list of
Birmingham artists. It is that of Mr. W. J. Wainwright,
A.R.W.S., who has accepted a commission for the Art
Gallery.</p>

<p>In the circular picture gallery will be found the admirable
series of historical works by Sir James D. Sinton,
P.R.I., representing scenes in the life of a soldier in the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Among the portraits of special local interest are those
by Mr. W. T. Roden, of Samuel Lines, the Birmingham
artist; of Peter Hollins, the Birmingham
sculptor; of his Eminence Cardinal Newman; and of
John Henry Chamberlain, who has been justly described
as the “second founder of the Birmingham and Midland
Institute,” and who, until his lamented death, was Chairman
of the School of Art. Those of John Bright, by
Frank Holt, R.A.; of George Dawson, by H. T. Munns;
of William Murdock, by John Graham; of Arthur
Ryland, the founder of the Birmingham and Midland
Institute, and sometime Mayor of the town, by Sir J. W.
Gordon; and of Sir John Franklin, by T. Phillips, R.A.,
also deserve note in this connexion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Watts and Portraits.</span>&mdash;The large room of the
Art Gallery is nearly filled with a collection of Mr. Watt’s
pictures, kindly lent by the artist. Much interest now
attaches to these works, as Mr. Watts has just offered
them, with others, to the nation. We can somewhat
measure this noble gift when we remember that the
collection contains portraits of some of our ablest and
most famous men, as well as large and important figure
pictures, the work of a lifetime, and that these are the
best works of an artist of world-wide reputation. The
English School of portraiture has attained a high standard
in the works of such artists as Millais, Holl, Ouless, and
Richmond; but the portraits by Watts stand apart from
even these in their nobility of treatment, scheme of colour,
and rendering of the man, his very life and soul. The
portraits of Mr. Burne Jones, the Marquis of Salisbur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>y,
and Lady Garvagh, recall to mind the best works
of Reynolds and Gainsborough. Again, Dr. Joachim, a
lamp-light study&mdash;is quite Rembrandt like. Those of
Cardinal Manning, Carlyle, Mr. Browning, Mrs. Manners,
in blue against a blue background; John Stuart Mill,
Lord Lawrence, Lord Sherbrook and Philip Calderon, R.A.,
also merit careful observation. Mr. Watts’s subject
pictures are painted with the noblest motives, and the
methods of execution and schemes of colour are all made
subordinate to the idea. The subject “Love and Death,”
was suggested by the struggle of near friends to resist
a fatal disease in a young man whom the artist was
painting; and here the power of art, imagination, colour,
conception, drawing of drapery and figure, all unite, not
for technical display, but to realize in an intense degree
the motive of the picture. The same may be said of
“Mammon;” dedicated to his worshippers. In the
previous picture the colour is blue-grey; in this it is gold
and scarlet. “The Meeting of Jacob and Esau” is a
striking instance of the successful definition of opposite
characters. “Orpheus and Eurydice” is descriptive of
the moment when Orpheus looks back, and when, by
reason of this act of impatience, Eurydice sinks back
to Hades. “Fata Morgana,” turning on her followers
through life, is also a splendid work.</p>

<p>This room further contains the large painting by
Professor W. B. Richmond, M.A., entitled “An Audience
in Athens during a Representation of the Agamemnon.”
This, too, is a most valuable decorative work of Art in the
attitudes, costumes and expressions of the audience, and
in the rendering in colour and tone of the clear sunlight
of Greece. Other decorative works in the Art Gallery
are Mr. Albert Moore’s “Dreamers,” lovely figures
most delicately painted in a scheme of yellow orange, grey
and green; “Sapphires,” blue and orange; and
“Canaries,” yellow orange and grey, with a little green.
On a screen will also be found a small but very fine
collection of works in water-colour by Mr. Walter Langley,
R.I., including “Amongst the Missing,” “Time moveth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not,” and many well known works by this artist.</p>

<p>The town possesses one of the strongest examples of
Sir Frederick Leighton, P.R.A. “A Condottiere” is quite
Titianesque in its painting of flesh, armour, and drapery.
One example by Mr. Alfred W. Hunt is also the property
of the town. It is called “A Norwegian Midnight,”
and therein are displayed colour, mystery, sense of space,
and moving cloud forms. Two of the finest paintings
by Mr. Henry Moore, A.R.A., are also included&mdash;“Summer
Time, off Cornwall,” and “The Newhaven
Packet.” Other works in the Gallery of more than
ordinary interest are: “Intellect and Instinct,” by
H. Stacey Marks, R.A.; “Detected Correspondence,”
by John Opie, R.A.; “A Martyr of the 16th Century,”
by W. Geets; “February Fill Dyke,” by B. W. Leader,
A.R.A.; “Ready for Work,” by John S. Noble; “A
North-West Gale,” by John Brett, A.R.A.; “Homeward,”
by W. Napier Henry; and “The Poacher’s Widow,” by
Breton Riviere, R.A.</p>

<p>It is a matter of real congratulation to Birmingham that
her sons have taken a prominent place in the world of Art,
and that, owing to an enlightened policy, the town now
possesses a suitable gallery, wherein high-class works may
be viewed by all. The works exhibited, whether purchased
by the Committee or on loan, are generally of such
a decorative character as to be of the greatest value to
designers and other Art workmen. It is to be hoped that,
stimulated by past example, as well as by present opportunities,
the inhabitants will fully appreciate the importance
of furthering that Art, which is at once a source of
pleasure to the workers, and of illimitable enjoyment to
the beholders.</p>

<p><b>Sculpture.</b>&mdash;[By <span class="smcap">Whitworth Wallis</span>.]&mdash;The history
of the birth and growth of sculpture, with no word for its
decadence, death, and ultimate renaissance would alone
be a subject difficult to compress into the space of a
volume, but when there is to be added to that some
account of the art in the time of the supremacy of its
achievement, before it became tainted with decay, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
task is vast indeed. Fortunately such a dissertation is
not required in this place.</p>

<p>The art of sculpture is not restricted, as most people
think, to the carving of mere marble and stone. In its
strict meaning it is the art of <i>cutting</i> any material whatsoever
into any required shape; but the word is now
generally accepted for the art of representing anything by
form, no matter what the material may be, or what the
method of its making; so that the word “sculpture”
applies to Sculpture proper, and to castings in bronze, as
well as to the carving of gems, ivories, and to modelling
in wax and clay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Egyptian Sculpture.</span>&mdash;In every part of the world, in
modern as in ancient times, savage races have delighted
to decorate their weapons with carving, and to make
representations of men and animals, which they afterwards
worshipped. But it was Egypt, that cradle-land of
learning and of art, which seems to be the nation where
first the rudeness of savage carving was brought under
restraint and nurtured into Sculpture. What had
previously been an amusement was changed by their
priests into an art. But these very priests who first
fostered the art were ultimately the means of stunting its
growth and arresting its highest development. The
reverence which long ages of worship caused the archaic
statues to receive induced the priests, who were the
representatives of learning and of wisdom, to make these
old types symbolical of divine attributes, and it was
considered sacrilegious to attempt to alter what had
gradually come to be believed was the true likeness of the
god. Thus religion, which was the kind foster-mother of
the arts of sculpture and painting, came, later on, to be
its most determined enemy.</p>

<p>Whilst in Egypt Sculpture was being strangled by
Convention, all progress being arrested, and all originality
starved out of it by the regulations which bound it to its
archaic form, a new race of artists arose along the shores
and amidst the islands of the Mediterranean. In Greece
Art found a new and happy home. Greek Sculpture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
based on Egyptian precedent, and influenced greatly in
its growth by Phœnician thought, gradually freed itself
from all the trammels of the past, and formed a school of
Sculpture, the results of which have never been equalled
in all the after ages of art production.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greek Sculpture.</span>&mdash;It was left to the beauty-loving
Greeks to perceive that Sculpture was of all others the
art by which they could best express and best immortalise
the most perfect of all Nature’s physical beauties. It was
the Greeks who made Sculpture what it was, and with
their school died out the highest development of the art.</p>

<p>The conquests of Alexander, and all that followed in
their train&mdash;the treasures of the East unfolded, mighty
monarchies founded, stately cities built&mdash;afforded opportunities
for the spread of this art. Thus it became
transplanted into strange lands, and was subjected to new
influence and aspirations. After the Macedonian and
Syrian wars the victorious Romans carried off with them
the statues and other art objects from the conquered
countries. Following in the train of their conquerors
came the Greek artists themselves to Rome, but the art
never became naturalised there, it soon lost all its ideality
and became merely imitative in treatment. Under
Antoninus it lost much of its grace and elegance, but the
spirit of the Greek is mighty even in dying, and though
it sank under Severus and his successors, its influence
was still apparent until close upon the time of Constantine,
when the great art of the ancients was entirely lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Italian Sculpture.</span>&mdash;Sculpture revived in Italy in
the thirteenth century under Nicolo Pisano. All the
remains of art which had escaped destruction from
barbarian violence, religious fanaticism, and natural
causes, were now carefully collected, and the sentiment
of reverence and admiration for the antique gradually
developed into that great revival which we designate
“The Renaissance.” The wealthiest and most powerful
Florentine families vied with each other in the encouragement
of art in all its branches, and with the artists of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries raised modern art to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>its
loftiest pitch of splendour. Despite this fact it never
attained the sublimity and tranquil grandeur of the
antique. After the glorious epochs of Michael Angelo
and Raphael a rapid decline set in. True feeling quickly
disappeared, giving way to affected grace, extravagance,
and excessive ornament. During the eighteenth century,
Winckelmann was the first who influenced the revival of
modern art, and opened the eyes of his contemporaries to
the glories and elevated beauty of the arts of antiquity.
Antonio Canova became the founder of the new period,
his works being specially marked by pure simplicity and
classical ideality, and by his side stands Thorwaldsen,
whose artistic productions were as admirable as they were
numerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">English Sculpture.</span>&mdash;In England John Banks, who
may be regarded as the father of English ideal sculpture,
paved the way for his great successor John Flaxman, and
the latter with his deep appreciation of severe simplicity
and true form, his love and admiration for the Greek
statues, brought into this country the classical spirit, and
founded the schools of the nineteenth century. To
judge by the progress which modern sculpture has
made, and by the many noble works erected of late years,
it is on a far safer road than during the end of the
sixteenth century. In England it is not likely that there
will ever be such a great school of sculpture as of the
sister art of painting. The greatest hope for ideal or
poetic sculpture rests with the people themselves, who
must be able to appreciate and love the beautiful, and
this elevation of the taste of the public can only be
accomplished by artists refusing to pander to a low ideal,
but fearlessly and jealously devoting themselves to the
execution of those works which will touch the tenderest
feelings and arouse the noblest thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Local Sculpture.</span>&mdash;Birmingham, though possessing
a fair number of sculptural monuments, can boast
unfortunately but of few which show real artistic merit.
In the Entrance Hall of the Free Libraries, Ratcliff
Place, stands Mr. Foley’s admirable statue of Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Albert, which is considered to be one of his finest works.
The Prince is attired in the robes of the Order of the
Garter. By its side is placed the companion statue of
her Majesty the Queen, which was also entrusted to
Mr. Foley. That artist unfortunately dying, the work
was carried out by Mr. Woolner, R.A., with far from a
pleasing result. Both statues are intended for the Council
House. The largest, and certainly one of the most prominent,
monuments in Birmingham is the bronze statue
erected by the inhabitants to the memory of Admiral Lord
Nelson. It is situated in High Street, and was
executed by Sir Richard Westmacott. It represents
Nelson in a reposeful and dignified attitude, his left arm
resting upon an anchor. The background is formed of
the prow of a vessel and a sail. The statue is mounted
on a pedestal of statuary marble, embellished with figures.
The corner posts are said to be cannon formerly in use
on board the “Victory.” An auctioneer, who lived in
High Street, left sixpence per week to be paid in
perpetuity, out of the rent of a house, to be devoted to
the cleaning of the statue.</p>

<p>The bronze statue of Sir Robert Peel, at the top of
New Street, is interesting as being the work of a talented
Birmingham sculptor, Mr. Peter Hollins, and for the fact
that it was the first bronze statue cast in one piece in
Birmingham. The attitude of the Statesman is one of
firmness; the face is very expressive, and shows strong
intellectual power. Mr. Hollins likewise executed the
statue erected to the memory of Sir Rowland Hill, which
stands in the Post Office, Paradise Street. Of other works
by this sculptor, I would draw attention to the busts of
William Scholefield, Mathew Davenport Hill, Q.C., and
David Cox, all of which are in the Museum and Art
Gallery, and a fine bust of J. W. Whateley, in the
General Hospital.</p>

<p>At the Five ways, Edgbaston, stands the statue erected
to the memory of Joseph Sturge, an eminent member of
the Society of Friends. The monument is pleasing in
arrangement. The centre figure represents Joseph St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>urge,
his right hand resting on the Bible, his left extended towards
a figure symbolical of Peace, whilst on the other side
is a figure typical of Charity. This is reputed to be an
excellent likeness of the philanthropist, and the expression
is one of benevolence and tenderness. It is the work of
the late John Thomas, a sculptor of some eminence,
who unfortunately died before he could put the finishing
touches to this memorial. Mr. Thomas was also the
sculptor of the statue of Thomas Attwood “the father of
Political Unions,” situated at the top of Stephenson Place.
Thomas Attwood stands in the act of addressing a public
meeting, the right hand outstretched, whilst his left
grasps a scroll bearing the word “Reform.” In the Art
Gallery is a fine bronze group of Boadicea and her
daughters, also the work of Mr. John Thomas.</p>

<p>In front of the Council House stands the statue of
Dr. Joseph Priestley, the discoverer of oxygen, who was
driven from the town by a Birmingham mob, and whose
property was destroyed in the riots of 1791. The statue,
a very pleasing one, is the work of Mr. F. J. Williamson,
of Esher, who is also the sculptor of the adjacent statue
of Mr. J. Skirrow Wright, and by the same hand is a
striking bust of Mr. Sam: Timmins, F.S.A., which stands
in the Reference Library, and an equally admirable bust
of the late Dr. Heslop, now in the Mason Science College.
This artist also executed the latest addition to Birmingham
Sculpture, the statue of Sir Josiah Mason, and was
also entrusted with the statue of the late George Dawson,
opposite the Art Gallery, which stands under a highly
ornate canopy, designed by the late John Henry Chamberlain.
This statue, which is supposed to be an excellent
likeness of Mr. Dawson, was executed on account of the
dissatisfaction caused by the first figure, the work of Mr.
Woolner, R.A. The effigy by the latter sculptor is still
most unfortunately permitted to remain in the vestibule of
the Free Library.</p>

<p>At the back of the Town Hall, stands a Memorial
Fountain, erected to commemorate the municipal services
of the Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, M.P. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
south side is a medallion portrait of Mr. Chamberlain,
by Mr. Thomas Woolner, R.A. The memorial, which is
architecturally treated and richly decorated with Venetian
mosaics, was designed by the late John Henry Chamberlain.</p>

<p>In Ratcliff Place stands undoubtedly the finest statue
in the town, that of James Watt, by Alexander Munro.
The calm dignity of the figure, the graceful pose of the
same, the grand thoughtful face, and the very remarkable
likeness of the great engineer, render it a work of the
highest excellence. The original model of the head is in
the Art Gallery.</p>

<p>The Art Gallery contains in addition to those already
mentioned as located therein, the two original plaster
models of Foley’s great statues of Burke and Goldsmith;
an interesting copy of the Venus di Medici by Raphael
Monti, and some very admirable specimens of early
Italian and renaissance sculpture. In the Vestibule stands
a very dignified and impressive bronze statue of Buddha
of Indian make, and of the greatest antiquity; and also a
very remarkable piece of Hindoo sculpture in black
marble.</p>

<p>In St. John’s, Deritend, is a memorial bust of John
Rogers, who edited the first English Bible, and was the
first martyr of the reign of Queen Mary.</p>

<p>The Parish Church of Handsworth, some little distance
from Birmingham, contains one of Sir Francis Chantrey’s
most remarkable and beautiful works, the statue of
James Watt; and by the same sculptor is a fine monument
erected to the memory of William Murdock. Here
is also the excellent bust of Matthew Boulton, by
John Flaxman.</p>

<p><b>Music.</b>&mdash;[By <span class="smcap">W. Bayley Marshall</span>.]&mdash;The most
casual observer cannot fail to notice the rapid strides
which Birmingham has taken in recent years in the cultivation
of Music. We have now an orchestra of nearly one
hundred performers composed of citizens of the town,
numerous choral societies both public and private, well-qualified
professors in all the branches of musical study,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and an excellent musical club. These combined agencies
are rapidly removing the stigma which was formerly so
truthfully applied&mdash;that Birmingham was like a boa-constrictor,
making a huge meal of music once every three
years, and doing little but sleep between times. In no
branch of music is this progress more manifest than in
the services of the church. Some sixteen years ago, it was
quite the exception to hear even the psalms chanted; now
choral services and well-rendered anthems may be heard
in most of the churches. The limits of this article will
only allow a brief reference to the principal societies and
agencies engaged in the furtherance of music in Birmingham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Triennial Festivals.</span>&mdash;The Birmingham Triennial
Festivals are now universally acknowledged to be the
most important Music meetings in the Kingdom. The
first Festival was held in 1768. In 1799 the scale of
the celebration was enlarged, and since then, with one
exception, they have been held triennially. The management
is in the hands of a small committee, appointed by
the Governors of the General Hospital, and the whole of
the proceeds go to the funds of that Institution; this has
amounted to upwards of £120,000 since the foundation
of the Festivals. During the period of more than a
century over which the Festivals have now extended, they
have attained European celebrity, and have been distinguished
by the production of a large number of original
works of the highest rank, among which may be mentioned:
Mendelssohn’s Lob-gesang (1840), and Elijah which was
specially written for the 1846 Festival; Costa’s Eli (1855),
and Naaman (1864); Bennett’s Woman of Samaria (1867);
Sullivan’s Kenilworth (1864), and Light of the World
(1873); Smart’s Bride of Dunkerron (1864); Barnett’s
Ancient Mariner (1867), and Paradise and the Peri (1870);
Benedict’s St. Peter (1870); Macfarren’s Resurrection
(1876); Gade’s Zion (1876) and Psyche (1882); Hiller’s
Nala and Damayanti (1871); Randegger’s Fridolin (1873);
Cowen’s Corsair (1876) and Sleeping Beauty (1885);
Gounod’s Redemption (1882) and Mors et Vita (1885)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>;
Gaul’s Holy City (1882); Stanford’s Three Holy Children
(1885); Dvorak’s Spectre’s Bride (1885). The next
Festival will be held in 1888. Secretary, Mr. R. L. Impey,
26, Waterloo Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Festival Choral Society.</span>&mdash;The date of the foundation
of the Birmingham Festival Choral Society, the
premier society of the town, is unknown; in 1834,
Mr. G. Hollins, the first Organist of the Town Hall was
appointed conductor; upon his death in 1841, Mr. Stimpson
was appointed to both offices, and the society was reorganised
and established with a permanent relief fund to
be employed in case of sickness among its members. In
consequence of ill-health, Mr. Stimpson resigned the
conductorship in 1855, and Mr. Stockley (the present
conductor), was appointed; Mr. Stimpson continuing as
organist of the town, the duties of which office he still
faithfully discharges. Since 1846, the choruses of the
Musical Festivals have been mainly composed of members
of the Festival Choral Society. The society gives annually
a series of high-class subscription concerts. The management
is in the hands of a Committee of fifteen members.
Secretary, Mr. S. V. Cornish, 55, Varna Road, Edgbaston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amateur Harmonic Association.</span>&mdash;The Birmingham
Amateur Harmonic Association was established in the
year 1855, and, as its name implies, is a purely Amateur
Association, more for the study and practice of choral
music than for the public performance thereof.</p>

<p>The members have, however, done good service in
placing before their friends at open rehearsals and private
concerts, from time to time, a great number of works
previously unknown to Birmingham, the most important
of which are&mdash;Handel’s oratorios, Jephtha (1871) and
Joshua (1872); Haydn’s First Mass (1859); Hummell’s
Mass in E flat, which was specially printed for the
Association, and produced for the first time in England on
December 13, 1865; Gounod’s Messe Solennelle in G
(1866), Gallia (1873), and Messe du Sacré Cœur (1878);
Schubert’s Mass in E flat, first performance in England
(1868), Song of Miriam (1869), and Mass in F (1884);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Benedict’s Cœur de Lion (1869); Gade’s Erl King’s
Daughter (1869); Sullivan’s On Shore and Sea (1872);
Macfarren’s St. John Baptist (1874); Smart’s Jacob (1875);
Beethoven’s Choral Fantasia (1875); Astorga’s Stabat
Mater (1881); Bridge’s Boadicea (1881); Hodson’s Golden
Legend (1884); Lloyd’s Hero and Leander (1884); and
for the first time in England, Raff’s Die Tageszeiten
(1885). Mr. Alfred J. Sutton was appointed conductor at
the commencement of the Association’s existence, and continued
in office until 1877, when, upon his resignation,
Mr. Stockley, the present conductor was appointed; the
members meet weekly for practice during the winter
months. The management is in the hands of a Committee
of fifteen members. Honorary Secretary, Mr. W. Bayley
Marshall, 15, Augustus Road, Edgbaston.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amateur Musical Union.</span>&mdash;The Edgbaston Amateur
Musical Union was established in 1863, for the cultivation
and encouragement of the taste for orchestral music, and
for the study and performance of orchestral works by the
great composers. This society has by hard work and
energetic management slowly but surely made its way; at
the first concert only fifteen amateur members assisted in
the band, only two of whom were among the wind department;
the band now consists of 47 members, is practically
complete as to wind, and even includes drums. The
library belonging to the society now contains a very fine
and complete collection of standard works besides a large
number of pieces of a lighter character.</p>

<p>Mr. C. J. Duchemin, who took a very active part in
the formation of the society, for nineteen years acted as
honorary conductor; upon his resignation in 1882, Mr.
Alfred J. Sutton was appointed conductor. Honorary
Secretary, Mr. R. B. Bandinelli, Pinson Villa, Fulham
Road, Sparkhill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philharmonic Union.</span>&mdash;The Birmingham Philharmonic
Union was established in 1870, upon a
somewhat similar basis to the Festival Choral Society,
under the conductorship of Dr. C. Swinnerton Heap.
The Society has given annually since its formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> a series
of concerts, with somewhat varying pecuniary success;
and, like its companions, has introduced many important
novelties, among which are:&mdash;Bach’s St. Matthew
Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, and Max Bruch’s
Odysseus. The Society meets weekly for practice. The
management is in the hands of a committee of nine
members. Secretary: Mr. C. H. Woodward, 71, Colmore
Row.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Midland Musical Society.</span>&mdash;The Midland Musical
Society was established in 1880 by the members of the
advanced singing class in connection with the Church of
the Saviour. Unlike the other musical societies of the
town, the Midland Musical Society is free, the members
not paying any subscription; the free use of a rehearsal
room being granted by the Church Committee, and the
conductor, Mr. H. M. Stevenson, being an honorary
officer. The Society possesses a lending library of over
1,000 volumes of music for the use of its members, and
now consists of a chorus of 240 and a well appointed
amateur band. Several concerts for charitable purposes
have been given by the members, and a series of ten
concerts for the working classes, in the Town Hall, to
which the admission was twopence and sixpence for floor
and galleries respectively, at one of which Gounod’s
Redemption was performed. It is the intention of the
committee to continue these concerts during the ensuing
season. Honorary Secretary: Mr. H. M. Parker, East
View, Robert Road, Handsworth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday School Union Choral Society.</span>&mdash;The
Birmingham Sunday School Union Choral Society was
established in 1880. As its name implies, this society is
connected with the Sunday School Union, and resulted
from the very successful annual festivals which were given
by a chorus of some 700, selected from the various schools
in the union. The society meets weekly for practice
under the conductorship of Mr. Alfred R. Gaul. Hon.
Secretary: Mr. H. Parkes, 33, Brighton Road, Moseley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Musical Society.</span>&mdash;The Birmingham Musical Society
was established in 1842 upon the basis of a friendly sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and benefit society, and for the social intercourse of music
lovers and especially for the practice of glee and madrigal
singing. The members meet fortnightly, and so successfully
have the affairs of the society been managed that
the invested funds amount to upwards of £2,000.
The excellent performances of the Birmingham Glee
Union, Messrs. Bickley, Woodall, Young, and Stilliard,
all of whom are members of the society, are well-known
throughout England. The onerous post of Musical
director, which has been filled by many musicians of note,
is now ably occupied by Mr. W. George Halliley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Musical Association.</span>&mdash;The Birmingham Musical
Association was founded in 1879 with the object of providing
a series of high-class concerts at popular prices,
establishing classes for musical instruction, vocal and
instrumental, and the provision of a large Musical Library.
Upon further consideration the establishment of classes
and the formation of a library were abandoned. The
weekly cheap concerts on Saturday nights have been
continued with a few intermissions during successive
winters and have now reached a total of 159, to which
the admission is threepence and sixpence for the floor and
galleries respectively. A band and chorus have also been
organised and have rendered material assistance at the
Saturday night concerts. Honorary Secretary, Mr. H.
Hendriks, 25, Cannon Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Harrison’s Concerts.</span>&mdash;This admirable
series of subscription concerts was established in 1870.
Prior to this the present senior partner, Mr. T. Harrison,
gave high class miscellaneous concerts at irregular intervals,
commencing as far back as 3rd February, 1853, when the
late Mr. Weiss and Mr. Sims Reeves (who was even then
spoken of as the great English Tenor), took part in the
programme. In 1870, Mr. Harrison took his nephew
Mr. Percy Harrison into partnership, and the annual
series of subscription concerts were inaugurated, the
management of which for enterprise and skill in securing
all the leading artistes, vocal and instrumental, of the
musical world, has made them well-known throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
kingdom. Besides treating their subscribers to such stars
as Patti, Nilsson, Albani, Titjens, Sims Reeves, Lloyd,
Santley, Maas, Norman Neruda, Sophie Menter, Charles
Hallé, Pachmann, Hans von Bülow, Joachim, Wilhelmi,
Piatti, Bottesini, &amp;c.; lovers of orchestral music have
been provided for by the annual engagement of Mr.
Charles Hallé’s well-known band.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stockley’s Concerts.</span>&mdash;The Subscription
Orchestral Concerts were instituted in 1873 by Mr.
Stockley, the conductor of the Festival Choral Society.
For the first few seasons these excellent concerts met
with but scanty support, and were carried on under
serious difficulties, and at a considerable loss; three
concerts were given each season, and the band consisted
of about 50 members. Mr. Stockley, however, steadily
persevered with the good work, and met with increasing
support; in 1881, the band was augmented to its present
number of 80, of whom no less than 76 are <i>bona fide</i>
residents in the district; in the following year the number
of concerts were increased to four each season; and the
support now accorded is most encouraging, the annual
balance-sheet no longer showing a loss. The programmes
have always included a complete symphony at each
concert, one or two classical overtures and smaller
orchestral pieces; two singers of eminence have been
engaged for each concert, and the vocal items as far as
possible arranged to correspond with the classical
character of the instrumental. Mr. Stockley must now
be congratulated upon the successful result of thirteen
years’ hard work, under very discouraging circumstances
at first, to popularise good orchestral music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chamber Concerts.</span>&mdash;Birmingham in the past has
persistently refrained from adequately supporting chamber
concerts, even when the quartette consisted of some of
the greatest living instrumentalists. Dr. C. Swinnerton
Heap, with praiseworthy zeal, gives an annual series of
high class chamber concerts, for which the subscription
list is much smaller than the excellence of the concerts
should command. It is to be earnestly hoped that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
labours will in the end be rewarded with the success they
so richly deserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Clef Club.</span>&mdash;The Clef Club was founded in
1881, to provide a central resort for the study and practice
of vocal and instrumental music, combined with the
general accommodation of a Club. Monthly Smoking
Concerts are held in the Club Rooms, the executants
being selected from among the members, and the programmes
confined to strictly “chamber music.” It may
safely be said that since its formation the Clef Club has
done much to elevate the taste of its members, and promote
the study and appreciation of chamber music. The
success which attended the development of the Club was
so great, that greatly enlarged premises soon became
necessary; and the promises of support being so
encouraging, it was determined to register the Club under
the Companies Act, and very greatly enlarge the original
scheme. Sir Arthur Sullivan kindly accepted the post of
President of the Club, and showed warm interest in the
details of the new scheme. The lease of the present club
premises in Paradise Street, close to the Town Hall,
having been secured, and the extensive alterations completed,
the club entered upon its new life in July, 1885.
In addition to the monthly concerts there is an impromptu
smoking concert every Friday night. Honorary Secretary,
Mr. F. E. Huxley, Clef Club, Paradise Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flute Society.</span>&mdash;The Birmingham Flute Society,
probably the only flute society in England, was established
in 1856 to encourage and develop the performance of
classical flute music; the Society possesses a very fine
library, consisting of all the concertante duetts, trios, and
quartettes of Berbiguier, Fürstenau, Kuhlau, Kuffner,
Kummer, Gabrielsky, and Tulou. The members meet
twice a month. Honorary Secretary, Mr. Arthur H. Hughes,
40, Chapman Road, Smallheath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Musical Instruction.</span>&mdash;There is no more important
step in the development of the study of music than a
thorough system of elementary education; the Birmingham
School Board, fully recognising this, in 1876 made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
provision for the systematic teaching of music in all the
schools under their control. Mr. W. Dobson was appointed
superintendent of musical instruction, and has
formulated a very thorough system; the tonic sol-fa
method is adopted and infants, if only seven years of age,
are taught to sing from note correctly. One hour per
week is allotted to this subject in two half-hour lessons;
in addition to this two or more classes are occasionally
grouped in divisions for united rehearsal and musical
drill. In addition to instruction in singing, violin and brass
band classes were commenced last winter, also on the
tonic sol-fa method, and have been very successful.
Many thousand children have thus been taught, by their
voices being trained in connection with the ear and
understanding, to sing correctly, and have been musically
educated in such a way as to enable them in after years
to listen intelligently and enjoy good music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">School of Music.</span>&mdash;The School of Music in its present
form at the Birmingham and Midland Institute was
commenced in 1885. Classes were established in the
following branches&mdash;theory of music, elementary and
advanced part singing and solo singing, (a separate class
for each voice, soprano, contralto, tenor and bass). The
pianoforte, violin (elementary, intermediate and advanced),
clarionet, flute, violoncello, and brass instruments generally.
During the first term there were 1,233 students in the
school, the fees range from one penny per lesson to half-a-guinea
for a term of 12 to 15 lessons. During the
current season the following additional classes have been
sanctioned by the Council&mdash;organ, bassoon, oboe, double
bass, and viola; and it is probable that classes will be
formed for ensemble orchestral playing and part singing.</p>

MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES<br />
(<span class="smcap">Birmingham and District.</span>)</h3>

<p class="author">BY C. J. WOODWARD, B.Sc.</p>

<p>In the following pages an attempt is made to give to the
reader some idea of the extent and variety of the manufactures
of our town and neighbourhood. The method
followed is to state at the outset the classes of material
which come into the town, and to follow these in the
mind’s eye through smelting furnace, forge, or workshop,
until they come out in a wonderful variety of articles, one
or more of which will ultimately be found in the possession
of every nation of the earth. To carry out the
proposed method with fulness and accuracy would require
a strict blockade of the town, similar to that adopted for
collecting town dues in continental towns with agents to
report the quantities and qualities of the goods passing in
and out. Failing this, we may, through the agencies of
the railway and canal companies obtain at least some
idea of the character and extent of our trade.</p>

<p>In preparing some statistics relating to goods brought
into and taken out of the town, I am particularly indebted
to the courtesy of Mr. Henry Wiggin, M.P., one of the
directors of the Midland Railway, and also to Mr. John
Noble, general manager of that railway; Mr. J. Grierson,
general manager of the Great Western Railway; and
Mr. G. Findlay, general manager of the London and
North Western Railway. Mr. W. Pilcher, of the Birmingham
Canal Navigations, and Mr. George, of the
Birmingham and Worcester Canal, have also been good
enough to supply information. In considering the traffic
of our town we must remember that Birmingham is not
only a manufacturing centre but a distributor of goods
which arrive here in bulk. This, coupled with the circumstance
that, from its inland position, there is a great
deal of through traffic, renders it difficult to obtain such
satisfactory figures as I hoped to have done when I commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>d
this work.</p>

<p>Statement of principal classes of goods coming into and
going out of Birmingham by railway during the year 1885,
with weight in tons of each class.</p>

<p>From one wharf alone in Birmingham there were
delivered into the town by canal last year about 40,000
tons of various goods, of which the following will serve as
examples&mdash;Timber, 3810 tons; salt, 443 tons; metals,
3948 tons; road stone, 10,821 tons; potatoes, matches,
mill stones, glue and groceries, 1221 tons, whilst traffic
over one of the canals in the course of the year was
7,327,269 tons, including merchandise, 972,749 tons; pig
iron, 586,434 tons; coal, 3,333,865 tons; iron stone,
495,912 tons; sand, 115,791 tons; lime and limestone,
140,828 tons; road materials and manure, 525,249 tons;
and bricks, 460,359 tons.</p>

<p><b>Nature of the Manufacturing Industries of
Birmingham and the District.</b>&mdash;It is difficult, if not
impossible to classify satisfactorily the varied industries of
Birmingham and the district. The one adopted has as
its basis, the raw materials of different kinds as used up
in the trades of the town. In order to obtain information
as to progress of the trades, or change in their character,
I have extracted from Kelly’s Directory of 1864 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
number of each trade as then given, and compared it with
the number in the last Directory published, viz., 1884:&mdash;</p>

<p>In reference to some materials, Mr. Arthur Robottom,
who has introduced a variety of new products for use in
Birmingham sends me the following notes: <i>Cryolite</i> from
Greenland, is used in making glass globes for the electric
light. <i>Nitrate of soda</i>, from Chili.&mdash;Mr. W. R. Lloyd,
merchant, Newhall Street, sold the first small lot to
W. C. Alston, about 50 years ago; since then I have s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>old
large quantities to the manufacturers of nitric acid. <i>Lard
oil</i> was first used in Birmingham. <i>Carnubia wax</i> (Brazil)
was first used in Birmingham for wax tapers. <i>Mica.</i>&mdash;The
first import of large plates from India was sold to
Griffiths and Browett for lanterns to be used in powder
magazines. <i>Istle or Mexican Fibre.</i>&mdash;The first bale
was sold by me to Mrs. Grew, of Church street, and
used for brush making. <i>Kourie Gum</i>, from New Zealand,
first used in Birmingham by Barratt, Postans and others
for varnish making. <i>Cow Hair</i> from River Plate used for
circular brushes in glass cutting. <i>Carozo nuts</i> or <i>Vegetable
Ivory</i>.&mdash;The first arrivals from Venezuela were sold to
Mr. Burgiss, of Great Charles Street, for toys; afterwards
some were obtained by Mr. Bricknall, button maker, who
first made buttons from this material. Subsequently the
late Mr. J. S. Wright, then a clerk with Smith and Kemp,
took up the material, and it soon became generally used.
Now some thousands of tons are consumed every year
for this purpose. <i>Piassava.</i>&mdash;“I sold the first small lot to
Richard Deen, and got him to retail it to Irishmen living in
London Prentice street and neighbourhood, to make into
bass brooms for hawking. At the present time some 200
tons per week of this material is made up into brooms.
<i>Gum Animi</i>, largely used in Birmingham for varnish.
<i>Button Lac</i> was first used in Birmingham by Joseph
Shorthouse, Market Street, who had the first five cases from
Calcutta, for the manufacture of lacquer. <i>Kiltool</i>, from
Ceylon. The first shipment came to me, I put it aside
in some stables at my house in the Coventry Road,
intending to sell it for putting under ripe strawberries,
but by accident I found out that by putting it into hot
oil it took a beautiful black colour. Upon this Mr.
Lovedee, of Bartholomew Street, at my suggestion, dressed
and prepared the material for the brush trade. It is now
used in great quantities.” <i>Lemon</i>, <i>Orange</i>, and <i>Citron
Peel</i>.&mdash;Large quantities sent to Birmingham to be candied
at Mr. Pattison’s works, Spring Hill. They are imported
from Sicily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>The reader having now some idea of the materials
entering our district, let us see generally, though in mere
outline, how these materials are worked up in the metal
trades.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ores.</span>&mdash;The only ores smelted in our district on a large
scale are iron and nickel and cobalt. Small quantities of
galena and copper pyrites are used. Spanish ore, an iron
pyrites containing two or three per cent. of copper, has
the sulphur burnt off in the chemical works, and the
copper is subsequently precipitated and refined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Metals and Alloys.</span>&mdash;Iron and steel are now
extensively produced from cast iron in our district by the
modern methods as well as by the older ones of puddling
in the case of iron, and cementing in the case of steel.
The basic Bessemer process has been adopted on a large
scale by Mr. A. Hickman, of the Spring Vale Furnaces,
Bilston. Three converters are used, one lined in the
ordinary manner (gannister), the other two with a paste
made of dolomite (magnesian limestone) and tar, the
process of conversion being commenced in the first named
converter, and finished in the others. At the same works
are modern type blast furnaces in which the waste gases
are utilised for heating the blast on the regenerative
principle, two stoves being those of Mr. Cowper’s system,
while there are three new ones invented by Ford and
Moncan. Messrs. Hatton and Sons of Bilston, adopt a
fixed Bessemer converter in which blast of low pressure
can be used. At the same works the Wilson gas producer is
used for re-heating furnaces, and an arrangement on the
Ponsard principle is adopted for raising the temperature
of the air used in the combustion of the gas. Mr.
Smith-Casson has in use at the Round Oak Works a novel
gas furnace of his invention. At the Patent Shaft and
Axle Tree Works a modification of the (Siemens) open
hearth furnace (an improvement by Dick and Riley) is
being used.<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> At Messrs. Cox Brothers and Holland,
Alcester Street, crucible steel is made. The cementing
process is carried on at the Brades Steel Works, Oldbu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>ry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Copper.</span>&mdash;The crude copper known as Chili bars and
precipitated copper from chemical works, where the sulphur
of the ore has been previously utilized, are refined
extensively in the neighbourhood of Birmingham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lead.</span>&mdash;Lead refuse of various kinds, together with
galena, is treated at one small works in the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alloys.</span>&mdash;In most cases manufacturers mix their own
metals. However, brass, German-silver, and other alloys
are extensively manufactured for the trade.</p>

<p>The metal or alloy having been made, is subject to
various general processes, either as preliminary to manufacture,
or in the course of manufacture, of which the
following are the principal:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Casting.</span>&mdash;From a drawing the pattern is made in
wood&mdash;⅛ of an inch to the foot longer in case of cast-iron,
and ³⁄₁₆ do. in case of brass to allow for shrinking.
The pattern is laid in sand, often contained in a casting
frame, which, from its plasticity, non-fusibility, and other
properties lends itself admirably for mould making. The
mould is dusted over with charcoal, or with a mixture
known as founders’ dust, and the casting then made by
pouring metal in. With small articles in brass, metal
patterns are used. For gold articles, such as wedding
rings, an iron frame is used, filled with the finest red sand.
For small gold work, the cuttle fish bone is used as a
mould, the pattern being pressed in the same manner as
in sand.<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> A special feature in the process of casting in
our district is the production of “chilled” castings for
rolls. The mould for the barrel part of the roll is a
heavy cylindrical casting of iron truly bored out to a size
sufficient to allow of the roll being turned to the required
size. The molten iron is run into the mould sidelong,
and from the bottom, so as to give the metal a rotatory
motion. This rotatory motion causes the dust and slag
to keep in the centre, leaving a pure metal in contac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>t with
the mould. This metal chilled by contact with the massive
metal mould, produces the hard and close texture required.<a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Keys, stirrups, hob nails, and many small articles are
produced by casting, the casting being afterwards
rendered malleable by the process of cementation, which
consists in packing the articles in an iron box with
powdered hæmatite, and heating from three to seven days.
Iron castings are also annealed by packing with cinders
in a box, which is then heated for some time, as with
the malleable cast iron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rolling, Wire and Tube Drawing.</span>&mdash;Iron, brass,
steel, and German silver are used up in the form of sheet,
wire, and tube. With large firms producing finished
articles, these processes are done on the premises,
but there are several works devoted to the production of
sheet metal, wire, or tube only, and rolling for the trade.
In the jewellers’ district, the cast ingots of the precious
metals are taken to rolling mills in the neighbourhood to
be rolled down to the required degree of fineness. For
some articles, such as spoons, where a blank is required
of varying thickness, strips of metal are thinned in parts
by what is known as “cross rolling,” the rolls being
exposed at one end, so that a strip of metal may be
passed through, which is thus thinned down at one end.</p>

<p>Tube drawing is effected by cutting a strip of metal
which is then passed through rolls to give it a gutter form.
One end of the gutter is now beaten up to form a tang
that can be gripped by the tongs of the draw bench, and
the gutter is pulled through a conical hole which roughly
forms the tube. The open seam of the tube is now
brazed, and after cleaning, this roughly formed tube is
slipped over a steel rod or mandril. Both mandril and
tube are drawn through a smooth circular hole when a
smooth uniform tube is formed. Fluted taper tubes are
made as described at (B. p. 324<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>) by means of “tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>s,” but a
novel method is now adopted for smooth taper tubes. A
wedge-shaped piece of metal is roughly made into a
conical tube which is put on a taper mandril revolving in
a lathe. A flat steel burnisher is pressed on to the tube
as it revolves pressing the metal to take the shape of the
mandril. Twisted tubes are produced by drawing the
tube through a revolving nut (B. p. 325<a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>), embossed or
ornamented tubes by drawing a plain tube through a die,
composed of a series, four say, of small wheels or pulleys
on the edge of each wheel being impressed the desired
pattern. As the tube is drawn through the die, the wheels
turn and impress on the tube the pattern they carry on
their surface. As stated (B. p. 326<a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>), the invention is due to
Mr. Fearn. It should, however, be mentioned that the
process failed in his hands, but was subsequently taken
up by Messrs. Winfield and Co., who, with the help of
their engineer, Mr. Thomas Preston, brought the process
to perfection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Press Tool Work.</span>&mdash;The next general process in the
manufacture of many metallic articles is cutting out a
blank into the requisite shape. This is done by what is
called a press tool consisting of two parts; one a firm
block of steel, in which is an aperture, circular, oval, or
whatever shape may be desired, and the other a punch of
corresponding shape, a piece of metal being placed over
the aperture, the punch is forced down by a screw of high
pitch on to the metal, when a blank is cut out at one blow,
and falls into a pan placed to receive it.<a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stamping.</span>&mdash;Used for hollowing blanks in a number of
trades. The blank cut by hand or tool is placed on a
mould or die, and a heavy weight, carrying on its lower
surface the counterpart of the mould, working in guides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
so as to fall true, can be lifted up and allowed to fall on
the blank until the metal is forced into the shape of the
mould. As the metal hardens by successive blows, the
blanks are annealed (that is heated and allowed to cool)
as often as may be found necessary.</p>

<p>The weight which gives the blow is supported by a
strap passing over a wheel in constant motion. So long
as the strap hangs loosely over the wheel, the friction of
the moving wheel is insufficient to lift the weight, but
immediately the workman makes the strap taut, the weight
is carried up and is let fall by the workman releasing his
hold on the strap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shaping.</span>&mdash;Thin metal is shaped by pressure applied
by means of a screw press, the metal being placed between
a die or mould and its counterpart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Automatic Machinery.</span>&mdash;A number of articles produced
from wire, such as pins, nails, hooks and eyes, hair
pins, etc., are made completely by automatic machinery,
the wire being wound off a reel at one end of the machine
and transformed into the various articles as it passes
along until it comes out at the other end of the machine,
a finished or nearly finished article.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Automatic Turning and Shaping.</span>&mdash;Gun stocks,
boot lasts, tool handles and other similar articles are
automatically turned. With a gun stock for example, the
rough form cut from a plank is put in a lathe, above is
placed a steel model or dummy of the form required to be
turned, the model and the wooden blank are made to
revolve at precisely the same speed, and a rotating cutter
travels slowly along from one end of the blank to the
other, the movement of the cutter inwards or outwards
being regulated by the dummy. The wooden blank
having been put in the lathes, the cutting is started, and
it then goes on until finished, when the lathe stops
automatically. The shaping of gun locks and many other
parts of the gun is effected by causing a revolving cutter
to be moved over a fixed steel model or dummy, the
cutter thus shapes the blank to a fac-simile of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>e pattern
or dummy.<a name="FNanchor_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spinning.</span>&mdash;Tea pot bodies and a variety of articles in
Britannia metal are “spun.” A piece of wood 4 or 5
inches in diameter is attached to the lathe head, and in
this a hollow corresponding to the bottom of the tea pot
is turned. A sheet of metal of a foot or so diameter is
now put against the wood and pressed into the hollow by
a wooden cylindrical mould with a round base which
corresponds to the concavity. The disc is rotated very
rapidly and the workman presses the soft metal over the
mould so as to form a vessel in shape somewhat resembling
a coffee cup with upright sides, the cylindrical mould
is taken out and replaced by a disc of wood in two halves,
held in place by a spindle from the back centre of the
lathe. The metal cylinder is now gradually closed in
until the opening is reduced to the required size, when the
body is complete. The spindle is withdrawn and the
divided disc of wood easily shakes out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drawing Through.</span>&mdash;Umbrella ferrules, pencil cases,
cartridge cases, and a variety of articles are made by
“drawing through.” The finest example of this process
is seen in the manufacture of a metallic cartridge case,
such as is used in the new Enfield-Martini rifle. I am
indebted to Mr. T. R. Bayliss, Managing Director of the
Birmingham Small Arms and Metal Company, for the
following particulars. The brass is rolled to the required
thickness.<a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It is then passed into a machine which forms
it into a shallow cup. This machine consists of a tubular
punch which cuts out a disc of 1.25 inch diameter, immediately
upon which a solid plug passing through the
tubular punch, presses the disc through a steel ring, so
that it falls to the ground as a shallow brass cup. Three
of these are produced by one blow of the press. The
cups are heated in a muffle to a red heat, then dip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>ped
in dilute sulphuric acid to remove scale, washed, coated
with soap and oil, and then passed through a second
machine in which a slightly narrower punch forces the cup
through a slightly narrower ring, and thus the cup, while
retaining the same thickness at the bottom, is made
slightly narrower and much deeper. Repetitions of the
process (six altogether) produce a case rather more than
half-an-inch wide and three inches long, which, when cut
off to proper length, indented at the bottom for reception
of the cap, and some other finishing processes gone
through, is ready for the charge of powder. The process
is applied to small articles like pencil cases, and at the
Small Arms and Metal Company to cases as large as 5·20
inch diameter and 15 inch long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soldering.</span>&mdash;Hard soldering or brazing consists in
fusing an alloy of high melting point between two junctions
of the metal to be soldered so as firmly to connect them.
The solder in fine powder is mixed with powdered borax,
and made into a puddle with water, and then spread about
the parts to be soldered together. The article is now
heated by fire or gas, and the moment when the solder
runs, is carefully watched. Gold and silver soldering used
in the jewellery trades is on a small scale similar to brazing,
the solder used is a gold or silver alloy of slightly lower
melting point than the article to be soldered: the borax is
commonly applied by previously rubbing down a crystal
on a piece of slate and the white puddle thus obtained
applied by means of a camel hair pencil to the junction
on which the solder is placed. The article is supported
on a piece of pumice stone and the necessary heat produced
by the flame from a mouth blowpipe. In soft
soldering an alloy of tin and lead is used, the melted alloy
being spread by means of a “bit” or “doctor,” consisting
of a piece of copper attached to an iron rod set in a
wooden handle. A flux called “monkey” or “spirit,”
consisting of muriatic acid with dissolved zinc, having
previously been applied. Formerly resin was used as a
flux, but this is now to a great extent superseded by the
mixture just spoken of.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Scratch Brushing</span> is used to produce a rich rough
surface previous to gilding. Revolving brushes of brass
wire scratch the surface of the article which is kept well
moistened with stale beer or with water to which size has
been added.</p>

<p>Of late years the <span class="smcap">SAND BLAST</span> has been introduced for
roughing surfaces. Sand is fed into a powerful blast of
air, and a fine frosted surface produced. If the article is
protected in places by a mask of paper or soft metal cut
out in any desired pattern, an ornamental pattern is
produced requiring only a little chasing to finish it. The
sand blast is used too in the production of an imitation of
engraved glass, in embossing glass as a substitute for hydrofluoric
acid, and for re-cutting old files.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dipping.</span>&mdash;In order to clean brass articles, they are
dipped into a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, the
temperature and strength of acid determining whether the
dipping is bright or dead. The bright articles are now
finished by burnishing or polishing, and are then ready for</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lacquering.</span>&mdash;The articles are laid on an iron table
heated to a temperature of about 230° F. by super-heated
steam. When warm, the lacquer, which is a solution of
shell-lac in spirits of wine, is brushed over, the spirit
evaporates and leaves a protecting coating of gum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold Cutting</span> or <span class="smcap">Lapping</span> in jewellery consists in
pressing articles against a rapidly revolving disc or “lap,”
composed of lead and tin, to the surface of which fine
emery has been applied. The faces of the article which
have thus been “cut” are subsequently polished on a
“bob,” that is on a wheel covered with leather on its edge
or circumference.<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colouring</span> in jewellery refers to a rich gold colour
obtained on gold articles. The process at first could be
applied only to jewellery of high quality, but now 15 and
18 carat gold is coloured. The articles are heated to
dull redness to destroy grease and dirt, then hung on
platinum wires and immersed in a boiling mixture of salt,
saltpetre, and muriatic acid and water. After drying out
in sawdust they are scratch-brushed.<a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>There are many extremely interesting processes in the
trades of our town besides those which apply exclusively
to the metal trades, but for these I have no space. Those
who wish for full information respecting the history,
position, and general character of the Birmingham industries,
must consult “Birmingham and the Midland Hardware
District,” edited by Mr. Sam. Timmins. This
volume, which was published on the occasion of the visit
of the British Association to the town in 1865, is exhaustive,
describing the trades as they then existed. In order,
however, to supplement Mr. Timmins’ book, application
has been made to various gentlemen who have been good
enough to provide the following short notices (or the
substance of them) of the various trades referred to at
length in the volume. In addition there are some notices
of industries which have been introduced since the year
1865.</p>

<p><b>Bedsteads, Iron and Brass.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">L. Brierley.</span>]&mdash;(B. 624.)
In 1849 there were only about eight manufacturers of
metallic bedsteads in Birmingham and the neighbourhood, whose
united production probably reached 400 finished articles per week.
In 1865 the number had increased to twenty, with a weekly output
of about 5,000; the number of makers within a radius of fifteen
miles is about forty, and the weekly production not far short o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>f
20,000. As the number of manufacturers increased, and competition
necessarily became keener, so improvements were continually being
effected. The old imitation bamboo cane gave way to more artistic
effects of colour. The pillars and rails were decorated with
flowers and Dutch metal, or with gold&mdash;accomplished partly by
hand, and partly by the process (long known in the potteries for
ornamenting china ware) called transferring. This somewhat
pronounced, if not “loud” style of decoration, though still in
demand for foreign countries, has in its turn been replaced by plain
polished surfaces, relieved at intervals with brass, nickel, or silver
plated joints, and mountings. Prices range now (1886) from 5/- or
6/- for a plain stump bedstead to £100 for electro-silver plated
canopy or fore part constructed to suit Oriental taste. The United
States now buys and also makes metallic bedsteads. Australia,
New Zealand, the Cape, Mauritius, Canada, East and West Indies,
the States of South America, Egypt, China, and to some extent,
Japan, purchase.</p>

<p>About 500 persons are now employed in Birmingham and neighbourhood
in the bedstead trade; the average earnings of men are
about 23/- per week, and of women about 14/- per week.</p>

<p>Within the last ten years wire mattresses have been introduced.
The price was formerly £4 to £5 for a mattress, according to
width. Now a good one may be obtained at a price varying from
20/- to 40/-.</p>

<p>While Birmingham and the district is the principal seat of the
bedstead trade there are extensive manufactories in London,
Manchester, Glasgow, and Bristol. Metallic bedsteads are also
made extensively in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and of late
years in the United States also. A great number are, however, still
exported to Spain and America in spite of the native competition,
and protective duties amounting to 45 per cent. Our trade with
Spain is very much reduced of late years in consequence of England
being denied the advantage of “the favoured nation” clause.</p>

<p><b>Block Paper and its Uses.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. B. Gausby.</span>]&mdash;(B. 574.)
Since the previous paper on this subject was written,
there has been no alteration in the process of manufacture, nor has
there been any marked development of the trade as a whole. The
manufacture of panels of various thickness has increased in consequence
of their adoption in the place of wood, where bending or
exposure to varying conditions of moisture are required. The great
quantities of trays imported from Japan for some time checked the
demand for moulded paper tray blanks, but the demand is now
returning. Fashion has however dealt less kindly with the manufacture
of slabs in blocks for the purpose of manufacturing artificial
jet ornaments. This branch of the trade is entirely destroyed.</p>

<p><b>Boiler Plate and Gas Holders.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">W. S. Sutherland.</span>]&mdash;(B. 93.)
In spite of heavy duties, boiler and gas apparatus
are still exported. Within the last twenty years m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>any types of
tubular boilers have been introduced, but the one fluted or Cornish
boiler, the simple egg-end, and the Lancashire and double boiler with
cross tubes are most generally used. Mild steel has been introduced
into boiler making and plate making during the last few years,
though it is still a contested point whether it is superior to iron when
all things are taken into consideration. It requires to have all rivet
holes drilled, and it must be carefully annealed, though the writer
is informed by Mr. Edwin Danks, of Oldbury, that steel makers
often prefer to have their plates either worked cold or at a red heat,
and not in the intermediate condition. Drilling machines especially
designed are now used. Hydraulic machines of greatly improved
construction have come into use for facilitating the operations in the
boiler yard. These machines are portable, the water being supplied
through a flexible tube. Improvements in the construction of the
internal boiler flues have been made to enable them to resist increased
pressure, and further to allow the expansion and contraction
of the flue without injury. Of these improvements, the most noted
are Fox’s corrugated flues, the bowling ring, the flanged flue, and
Arnold’s flue.</p>

<p>An improvement introduced by the writer into boiler plate working,
is the system of welding by gas, adopted in Birmingham by
Messrs. Piggott, and by Messrs. Lloyd and Lloyd, for tubular and
other work and applied by Mr. Puplett for welding plate sheets of
steel only, 12 and 13 w.g. thick into ice moulds. It is found that
the strength of the weld equals that of the solid plate, and the
process is a cleanly and convenient one. Hemispherical sugar pans of
8 and 9 feet diameter without a joint are made by Messrs. Piggott,
who use this process. <i>Gas Holders.</i>&mdash;Since 1865 much larger gas
holders have been made. The two designed by Mr. Hunt, and
recently erected at the Windsor Street Works, Birmingham, have
each a capacity of 6,000,000 cubic feet, and are at the present time
the largest in the world.</p>

<p><b>Brassfoundry.</b>&mdash;(B. 225). No important changes
have taken place in this trade since the last report was written. At
Messrs. Winfield’s and other makers, light and elegant “electroliers,”
for electric lighting, have been added to the usual run of work. A
general cheapening of brass articles has resulted among other
causes from the reduction in price of copper. In the table (B. 259)
it will be seen that in 1855 copper was £126 a ton, the prices since
1865, when it was £92, have been&mdash;</p>

<p>The increased imports from America account for the fall in price, the
increase in Lake Superior copper alone being from 25,439 tons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
1882, to 35,000 in 1885.<a name="FNanchor_54_55" id="FNanchor_54_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><b>Button Trade.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. P. Turner.</span>]&mdash;(B. 432.) A
fashion for covered buttons in various qualities of mohair or its
imitations, in diagonal patterns, has prevailed at home and abroad
for some years. These are largely made in Birmingham, but as
many or more are imported from Germany, where the covering is
<i>wholly</i> produced, and, further, a better finish to the buttons is
obtained. <i>Vegetable Ivory or Carozo Nut Buttons.</i>&mdash;The Germans
produce more beautiful designs and superior finish at the same prices,
and the Birmingham markets are now almost annihilated. The
foreign trade Birmingham once had is extinguished. <i>Pearl Buttons.</i>&mdash;Since
1865 a new supply of pearl shell has been obtained from
various parts of the coast round Australia, and this locality is our
chief source of supply. It is worth £200 per ton for picked parcels,
and about £150 per ton when delivered here. The best of this
shell is equal or nearly so to the best Macassar shells. Panama
shells are now found in but small quantities, and instead of only
fetching £20 to £30 per ton, as quoted in 1865, they are now worth
£50 to £70. <i>Glass Buttons.</i>&mdash;Some fancy glass buttons made in
Birmingham are still unsurpassed in style, but the sale is a limited
one. More than ever come from Bohemia, where they are better
made than formerly, and equally low in price.</p>

<p>The button trade in Paris has had to yield to German competition
equally with that in England.<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><b>Cast Iron and Hollow Ware.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">W. Kenrick,
M.P.</span>]&mdash;(B. 103.) Since 1866 the increase in the trade is remarkable,
and some important improvements have been introduced
by which the public has obtained a very superior article, at a price
quite as low, if not lower than before. Roughly speaking, the trade
has doubled in twenty years. Enamelled iron ware has become
better known and more appreciated. Ten firms are now engaged in
this manufacture. Messrs. Baldwin, of Stourport, have introduced
and patented a new process, whereby they claim the production of a
better enamel at a lower price, owing to the use of a single coat.
This variety is called mottled enamel ware.</p>

<p>Messrs. Kenrick were the first in the trade to introduce a cover
stamped out of a single piece of metal without rivet or seam, and
this was manufactured under a patent taken out by Mr. Ryland in
1868. Since then the adoption of a solid cover has extended
generally throughout the trade. By another patent, the firm fixed
the tubular handle to the saucepan by means of a socket in which
the tube was securely locked without a rivet.</p>

<p>The process of annealing has been improved by a saving of time
occupied in the process. Machinery has been introduced into th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>e
moulding of hollow-ware, the stamping and finishing of covers, and
the dressing of hinges and sash pulleys.</p>

<p>The odd work which comprises most small articles of cast iron
used by builders’ furnishers, &amp;c., has undergone a great change in
appearance, owing to the introduction of a new style of finish from
America. A coat of transparent varnish is now applied, the iron
being previously polished on those parts in relief, and the result is an
appearance somewhat resembling antique bronze. This, together
with greater lightness and elegance of design, has given an impetus
to the trade, and has led to the introduction of iron where brass was
previously used.</p>

<p>The favourable conditions of labour described in 1866 still prevail,
though it may be added that progress in this direction has at least
kept pace with the advance in progress of manufacture, and the
greater excellence in the ware produced.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Factory Acts have long applied to this
industry with beneficial results. The hours of labour have been
reduced, and thanks to the Education Act of 1870, the intelligence
and docility of the younger operatives are their notable characteristics.
What is now wanted is the establishment of Science and
Art classes where the principles which underlie processes may be
learnt, and the power to add beauty of form to articles of utility
may be acquired. When these branches of technical training are
added to the course of elementary instruction in our public Schools, all
that is needed to secure the prosperity of British industry will have
been done.</p>

<p>The best relations as a rule now exist between employers and
employed; the former are less exacting and more sympathetic, the
latter take juster views of the relation of capital and labour, and are
more ready to co-operate with their employers to a common end.
The wider introduction of machinery has been attended with the
larger employment of female labour, and this seems to be an
inevitable tendency of modern processes of manufacture. On the
other hand many more skilled workmen are required in the fitting
and machine shops, which now form an important department in
large works of the class here described.</p>

<p><b>Clocks.</b>&mdash;Within the last year or two a new industry
has been imported into the town by Mr. Edward Davies, formerly
of the Ansonia Clock Company, Brooklyn. A company has been
formed under the name of the British United Clock Company, of
34, Farringdon Road, London. The works are in Great Hampton
Street, Birmingham. The company make the round or drum-like
time pieces, the works of which are machine-made, the parts being
interchangeable, and are supplied retail at a few shillings each.</p>

<p><b>Coinage.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Ralph Heaton</span>].&mdash;(B. 552). Coining
presses devised by a German named Uhlhorn, but manufactured and
improved by Messrs. Heaton, have been supplied to the Royal Mint.
The great advantage of the new presses is that they require no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
foundation, and are silent and automatic in action. The blanks are
dropped into a tube, and the machine carries them forward one by
one to the dies, where they are finished and fall into a box in front
of the workman.</p>

<p>With regard to the manufacture of blanks, Birmingham has from
time to time furnished these to a number of States, and is doing so
now. Nickel coinage (an alloy of 20 per cent. nickel, and 80
per cent. copper) has been supplied to Jamaica in pence, half pence,
and farthings. In 1884, seventy-five tons nickel alloy were coined for
Servia, and an entirely new coinage of both silver and nickel for the
Republic of Ecuador. At the present time (1886) Messrs. Heaton
are supplying Columbia and Egypt with nickel coinage. The nickel
alloy is an excellent material for coinage.</p>

<p>In 1872 the Birmingham Mint delivered silver blanks to the Royal
Mint, for a coinage of the nominal value of £1,000,000. This was
completed in six months.</p>

<p>The letter H below the date will be found on many of the bronze
coins in circulation; this implies that the coins were struck at the
Birmingham Mint. At the time of their introduction in 1875, it was
supposed that an extensive gang of forgers were at work, and the
mint authorities were communicated with by an anonymous writer,
who stated that the counterfeit coins could be distinguished by the
small letter H below the date.</p>

<p>Messrs. Heaton have supplied coins to no less than 39 states or
authorities. In 1868, the Italian Government ordered five million
lire in pieces of 10 centimes; and in consideration of the satisfactory
manner in which this and other coinages had been carried out, his
majesty, King Victor Emmanuel, conferred the honour of knighthood
on the firm.</p>

<p><b>Electric Lighting.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Henry Lea, M.I.M.E.</span>]&mdash;The
period of fifteen years following the last Meeting of the British
Association in Birmingham, in the year 1865, was devoid of any
undertakings in electric lighting, other than in the direction of the
application of powerful arc lights for lighthouse purposes, as
practised by Messrs. Chance Bros., of Spon Lane, near Birmingham,
who, beginning in 1862 with apparatus having optical adjustments
for electric arc lights of small power, proceeded to introduce more
and more powerful lights, of which the Souter Point revolving light
of the 2nd and 3rd order built in 1870, the South Forelands fixed
lights, two in number, and of the 3rd order, built in the same year;
the Sydney Heads light of the 1st order and of 11,000 candle
power, built in 1880; and the flashing light at Tino, near Spezia,
a lamp of the 2nd order, finished in 1885, are examples shewing
the great progress made during the period referred to. The Sydney
Heads light is said to be the leading light of the world. The
motive power employed for it is the Otto silent gas engine. The
carbons are 23 millimetres, or upwards of ⅞″ in dia. Particulars
of these undertakings will be found in a special paper upon Ligh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>thouse
Work in another part of this volume. The first application of
arc lighting for ordinary business purposes in this district is believed
to be that of the Birmingham Household Supply Association
Limited, which was fixed in the year 1880-1 under the superintendence
of the writer, who employed a pair of 8″ × 12″ Horizontal
Tangye Engines to drive a Brush Dynamo working sixteen arc
lamps. Amongst other examples of arc lighting subsequently put
down may be named those at Messrs. Brown Marshalls &amp; Co.’s Carriage
Works at Saltley, Messrs. John Wilkes and Sons’ Rolling Mills in
Liverpool Street, Messrs. Elkington &amp; Co.’s Show Rooms, in Newhall
Street, the New British Iron Co.’s Works at Corngreaves, the
Lower Grounds at Aston Park, and Messrs. Cadbury Bros.’ Cocoa
Manufactory, near Birmingham, the latter being only very recently
started upon the Gulcher system.</p>

<p>The incandescent or glow electric lamp, first made its appearance
upon a large scale in Birmingham, in the year 1882, when the
Birmingham Town Hall was successfully illuminated for the Triennial
Musical Festival, by Messrs. R. W. Winfield and Co., who had allied
themselves with Messrs. R. E. Crompton and Co., of Chelmsford, for
electric lighting undertakings. This installation was established
under the writer’s superintendence, and consisted of 440 Swan glow
lamps, suspended from ornamental pendants placed around the walls
of the Hall, a chamber having very nearly the proportions of a
double cube, and measuring 165ft. × 65ft. × 65ft. high. Various
lamps in other rooms raised the number to 500. Cables were laid
underneath the streets, for a distance of about a quarter of a mile, to
the works of Messrs. Winfield and Co., in Cambridge street, where
nine Bürgin Dynamos, separately excited by two similar machines,
were employed to generate the electricity, the motive power being
the old rolling mill engine, from the flywheel of which a belt conveyed
the motion to the electric machinery. This wheel, being 25ft.
diameter, weighing about 25 tons, and revolving 50 times per minute,
afforded a source of motion, the steadiness of which left nothing to
be desired. The marked difference of temperature in the Town
Hall during the evening performances, as compared with the previous
use of gas&mdash;70° at the ceiling instead of 110°&mdash;was fully appreciated
by the large audiences of that festival. Subsequently the
number of lamps was increased to upwards of 600, by the addition of
two pendants. The same means of illumination were used for the
1885 Triennial Festival, as well as on many occasions of concerts,
etc. The whole plant still remains the property of Messrs. Winfield
and Co. Upon somewhat similar lines the same firm fitted up the
Leeds Town Hall, for the Festival of 1883, where, however, the
whole of the light was derived from pendants suspended from the
ceiling by steel wire ropes. The machinery in this case was also
situated about a quarter of a mile from the Town Hall.</p>

<p>In the year 1882, Messrs. Elwell, Parker, and Co., commenced
electrical business in Wolverhampton, with secondary or storage
batteries constructed upon a modification of the Planté method <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>of
manufacture. Shortly afterwards, the same firm began to make
dynamos for charging their batteries, since which time the output
has increased, and now amounts to a total of about 500 dynamos,
besides several thousands of storage cells, the latter being now made
under the joint Patents of the Wolverhampton Firm, and the
Electrical Power Storage Co., Limited, of London. The London Stock
Exchange, Lloyd’s Shipping Offices, the Manchester Art Gallery,
Lord Shrewsbury’s seat at Ingestre Hall, the Lancashire and Yorkshire
Railway Co., the Blackpool Electric Tramway, the Giants’
Causeway Electric Tramway, the Cannock Chase Colliery, the
Grosvenor Gallery and many other establishments are lighted or
worked by means of dynamos manufactured by the Wolverhampton
firm.</p>

<p>Amongst installations set up in Birmingham under the writer’s
superintendence may be mentioned the Theatre Royal, in New
Street, and the Prince of Wales Theatre, in Broad Street, in each
of which the plant consists of a 16-<span class="smcap">H.P.</span> Otto silent gas engine,
driving a 300 light Ferranti alternate current dynamo with a
Siemen’s exciter, and with appliances at the prompt side for lowering
or turning out the light at will. 200 lights are run very brightly
with an expenditure of about 800 cubic feet of gas per hour. A
similar number of ordinary gas burners would require from 1,000 to
1,200 cubic feet of gas per hour. The Birmingham Liberal Club,
in Congreve Street, another example, has 160 lamps which are
worked from a 10-unit compound dynamo, made by Messrs.
Crompton and Co., of Chelmsford, the motive power being a 12-<span class="smcap">H.P.</span>
compound steam engine, by Messrs. Marshall, Sons, and Co.,
Limited, of Gainsborough. This machine is an excellent specimen
of a self-regulating dynamo, the commutator not having been touched
with anything coarser than well-worn emery cloth since February
last, its surface presenting a highly-polished appearance. No
storage cells are used, the lighting being derived directly from the
machine.</p>

<p>In the suburbs, the house of Mr. Mitchell, Hagley Road,
Edgbaston, has about 40 lights, and is worked from a 2-<span class="smcap">H.P.</span>
Otto silent gas engine, and a 2-unit Crompton shunt-wound
dynamo, charging 24 storage cells of the E.P.S. (Electrical Power
Storage Co.’s) type.</p>

<p>The writer’s house, 7, Clarendon Road, Edgbaston, is also
electrically lighted by 24 E.P.S. cells, charged by a 30-light
Chamberlain &amp; Hookham dynamo, worked from a ½-<span class="smcap">H.P.</span> Otto
gas engine.</p>

<p>Messrs. Chamberlain &amp; Hookham began, a few years ago, the
manufacture of dynamos having permanent steel magnets, but they
subsequently adopted the more usual type of electro-magnetic
machines. Particulars are not to hand of this firm’s work, but the
residences of Messrs. Walter Chamberlain and Herbert Chamberlain
are amongst the examples of domestic electric lighting carried out
by the firm, whose attention, however, has been directed principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>ly
to the manufacture of dynamos for electro-depositing purposes, where
very heavy currents of low electro-motive force are required.</p>

<p>The public supply of electricity was in 1882-3 the subject of
much attention on the part of Messrs. Winfield &amp; Crompton, under
whose auspices the Incandescent Electric Lighting Co. Ld. was
registered. An Act of Parliament was obtained, and plans and
estimates were made by the writer for lighting a large district in
Birmingham from central stations. Carefully collected statistics of
the gas consumption in the proposed district afforded some interesting
information, such as, for instance, that the average cost of gas per
burner per annum, called the burner earnings, varied from 2d.
to 43/6 per burner per annum, and showed a mean earning for
the whole district of 10/2 per burner per annum, the average
price of gas being about 2/3 per 1,000 cubic feet. From various
causes, chief amongst them being the adverse restrictions of the
Electric Lighting Act of 1882, the operations of the Company have
remained in abeyance. The Birmingham Act is, however, still in
force, and should the efforts which are now being made for the
removal or substantial modification of the obnoxious clauses of the
Act meet with the desired success, Birmingham may yet enjoy the
advantages of a public supply of electric light, the luxury of which
only those who have lived in an electrically lighted house can fully
appreciate.</p>

<p><b>Flint Glass Manufacture of Birmingham.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">A.
C. Osler.</span>]&mdash;(B. 526.) Further inventions have been made
with regard to furnaces. Frisby’s patent, the fuel inserted from
below, instead of being thrown on the top of the fire, has met with
some amount of favour, having been adopted by several Stourbridge
houses. Bœtius’s patent, by which the earlier stages of combustion
take place below the floor of the furnace, and a current of heated air
is supplied to complete the combustion as the inflammable gases
pass through an opening in its floor into the furnace itself, has now
been in use at Messrs. Osler’s for many years.</p>

<p>The process of etching by hydrofluoric acid, has been largely
developed as a means of ornamenting glass, and has to a large
extent superseded engraving. Highly artistic designs are produced
by a combination of etching and engraving. Mechanical methods
are adopted in producing many effective borders.</p>

<p>Among new inventions for the ornamentation of glass, should be
mentioned the process of “threading,” that is, the surrounding and
partial covering of a body of glass of one colour with a continuous
thread of glass of another colour, by which many beautiful effects of
varying and toned colour are produced.</p>

<p>Recent years have also seen the revival of what is termed cameo
cutting on glass. A body of glass being formed of layers of different
colours, the outer layer or layers are partially removed by eating

revived art, which offers excellent opportunity for the combination

ornamentation.</p>

300 people were employed in the trade, there are now about 380.

<p><b>Hydraulic Machinery.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Messrs. Tangye.</span>]&mdash;(B. 647.)
The Cornwall Works have rapidly extended, now
occupying six times the area covered in 1865. 2,000 men are
employed. In addition to hydraulic machinery, steam engines,
machine tools, machinery for gas works, patent retort lids, gas
stoking and charging machines, gas engines of a novel and
economical type, steam boilers of all kinds, and fixed and portable
steam cranes are manufactured. These works will now turn out per
month 200 steam pumping engines, 40 steam boilers, 100 steam
engines used for other purposes than pumping, 800 cranes, crabs,
and lifting apparatus. 300 hydraulic presses, lifts, and jacks. 5,000
complete sets of pulley blocks, and 1,000 gas retort mouth-pieces
and lids.</p>

<p><b>Jewellery.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">John Bragg.</span>] (B. 452).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Extent of
the Trade.</span>&mdash;This general title includes a number of so called
“Trades” which appear in the Directory under separate heads.
It covers not only gold and silver “Jewellers,” but gold and silver
chain makers, gilt, plated, and black ornament jewellers, as well as
all those subsidiary branches which exist solely for the general trade,
such for instance as lapidaries, stone dealers, gold cutters, chasers,
engravers, jewellers’ die sinkers, tool makers and stampers,
enamellers, case makers, and also jewellery factors. In several
large establishments, many of these separate departments are carried
on within the walls and under one central management. The Post
Office Directory for 1885 gives 1,123 master-men thus engaged in
Birmingham. To these however must be added a large number of
“garret” masters or “out workers” whose names do not so appear,
and who employ perhaps only one, two, or three persons each. It
is estimated that 14,000 to 16,000 persons are actively employed in
this trade in Birmingham, while probably 40,000 to 50,000 are
locally dependent upon it. The amount of capital here engaged
in it is enormous, and, without doubt, larger than any other distinct
and separate trade of the town. The manufacture is still, as at last
report, aggregated in one locality, though it is extending its area.
The central point is near to where Warstone Lane is crossed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Northampton Street or Vyse Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Labour and Wages.</span>&mdash;The increase of female labour, particularly
in silver jewellery and in warehouse duties, is very considerable,
and has tended to keep down the wages of men. Still, these have
risen to very high points in seasons of prosperity, and even in the
present time of depressed prices, a skilled journeyman jeweller earns
with his own hands 30s. to 45s. per week of about 54 hours. A
trade society exists, but nothing approaching to a “strike” is
possible, because of the infinite variety of departments, the constant
change of patterns, and the habit of each workman agreeing
personally with his employer or foreman as to prices of piece work.
Most of the manufactories are well ventilated, the newly built ones
being large and commodious in every respect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bullion Used.</span>&mdash;An estimate has been made by those most
competent to judge as to the value of gold and silver used by this
trade in Birmingham per annum. Taking the last three or four
years as a basis, it seems probable that the annual consumption of
gold here is about £750,000, and of silver (at the present low price)
from £300,000 to £350,000. One large manufacturer of silver
jewellery has, within the last three years, used upwards of 3,000 oz.
of fine silver per week. Sovereigns are still extensively used to
melt instead of grain gold.</p>

<p>It may be asked, “Why melt sovereigns when gold, commercially
pure, can be had from the dealers without paying costs of minting?”
The answer is: the cost of minting is so small that against the other
advantages attaching to the practice, it is of no account. These
advantages are&mdash;1st, the grain gold of commerce cannot be relied
upon for absolute freedom from accidental or superfluous alloy; and
2nd, that other qualities, such as uniform hardness, tenacity, and
ductility&mdash;of the utmost importance to some branches of the trade&mdash;are
ensured by using them. The metallurgical science and technical
skill of our national assayers and melters at the mint, are therefore
freely used by our manufacturers to enable them to alloy to the
utmost nicety, and yet with a certainty of their goods, when made,
passing the “Hall.” This, therefore, is a question of economy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Changes in the Trade.</span>&mdash;The immensely increased production
of silver jewellery has tended to almost obliterate two departments
which twenty-five years ago were of large proportions&mdash;viz., the gilt
and the plated jewellery trades. The workmen in these branches
have mostly turned their hands to silver working. Notice must be
taken of some new developments, which have become practically
new trades to the town. The manufacture of costly official insignia,
such as mayoral chains, municipal badges, presentation caskets, gold
and silver ceremonial keys, &amp;c., is new since last report. More than
seventy such mayoral chains have been made here since then. The
manufacture of watch cases in gold and silver, but particularly in
silver, is also a new and very considerable trade, employing
hundreds of people. Not fewer than 60,000 to 80,000 silver watch
cases per annum are now turned out from Birmingham manufactories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>.
Another new trade, though at present not a large one, is
diamond cutting, but there is no reason why it should not become an
important business here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artistic Progress.</span>&mdash;How far the trade has led or has followed
public taste it is impossible to say, but that a general improvement
has taken place is undeniable. In place of the huge bracelets,
brooches, earrings, and lockets of twenty years ago, we now have
small and elegant articles of the most tasteful designs. Even such
jewellery as is produced greatly by the aid of machinery, for the
sake of cheapness, is often characterised by perfect style. Silver
brooches may be bought wholesale for one shilling each which
would not disgrace any wearer of the most refined taste. In the
gold trade also, the productions for the great middle classes are
equally neat and commendable, both as to form and detail of
decoration. The greater use of gems, both in gold and silver
jewellery, is a distinct feature of present requirements. A most
remarkable evidence of the above statements is afforded by one
branch of the trade, which now exports to France, Germany, and
Switzerland goods in large and increasing quantities, winning its
way by style as well as price against the best makers of the
Continent. Compared with the like classes and prices of goods
twenty years ago, there is no doubt but that beauty of design is
greatly improved; nor can there be a doubt either but that our
National Art Teaching has chiefly contributed to the improvement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chemistry.</span>&mdash;Chemistry has considerably improved the various
processes in which its aid can be applied. Alloying is more skilfully
and exactly performed. The art of melting is better understood.
“Coloring” (which must not be confounded with “gilding”) is
now carried to a pitch of remarkable excellence. At date of last
report, this, which is a purely chemical process, was done without
much intelligence, and nothing lower than 15 carat gold could be
with certainty so finished. But now those who devote themselves
specially to this branch of work, can produce a beautiful
“color” on 12 carat gold. It must, however, be stated, that
upon the lower quality, such bloom and rich colour is fugitive,
while upon the higher qualities it is permanent. Gilding by
electric processes is done with increased economy and skill.
Parcel gilding, oxydising, and gilding with various colored
alloys in solution, are carried to a high pitch of excellence. The
chemical treatment of waste, such as shop sweepings, and the water
used for washing of hands is much improved. In the business of
refining, scarcely anything is lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mechanical Conditions.</span>&mdash;So much depends, and will always
depend upon skilled handicraft in the Jewellery trades, that there is
not much to record in the way of mechanical progress. Still, in
some tools there are notable improvements. The ingenuity manifested
in the mechanical production of gold and silver “parts,” to be
afterwards put together into great varieties of patterns, is remarkable.
“Sand blast” is a new mechanical means used for producing the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
dead surface so much admired on gold and silver. The lathe, draw
bench, die stamp, and press, effect much more than they did for the
trade 20 years ago. Gas engines are now commonly used, even in
small shops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Precious Stones.</span>&mdash;The gem and precious stone business together
with that of the lapidary form a most important element of
the jewellery trade. We have some 35 local stone dealers and
lapidaries. Besides these, Birmingham is visited constantly by
dealers from London, Paris, Hamburg, and elsewhere, who do large
trades here. Diamonds and other gems in the rough are also sold
here increasingly. Compared with date of last report, the sales of
diamonds and other gems to the trade in this town is probably
twenty times larger. Single firms will each buy and mount up
£20,000 or £25,000 worth of gems in a year. It is now a recognised
and distinct name of this branch of the trade, “Diamond and Gem
Mounter,” and the Directory gives about 25 of those who do not
ordinarily interfere with other jewellery. Many Birmingham factors
now carry magnificent stocks of diamond goods manufactured here,
which was not the case twenty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prices and Cheapness.</span>&mdash;Any comparative notes which did
not recognise the cheapness of modern jewellery would be incomplete.
This cheapness is a real thing and not a delusion. Genuine
gold and silver brooches, rings, bracelets, &amp;c. set with gems, are
now offered throughout the country, at prices which often cause
doubts of their quality. Gold, it is true, remains at the same
standard value; but silver is one-fifth lower in price. Several causes
have acted together, resulting in this considerable reduction in retail
selling prices of both gold and silver goods. First, workmen’s
prices are much lower, although their total weekly earnings are not
materially altered. This is effected by mechanical improvements;
by the larger quantities of one pattern made at once; and by the
employment of girls and youths under men. Secondly, the rates of
profit realised by manufacturer, factor, and shopkeeper are lower.
Lastly, diamonds and some other gems extensively used are much
lower in price, especially their second and third qualities, than
at date of last report.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Distribution.</span>&mdash;as a rule, manufacturing jewellers neither
cultivate trade with shopkeepers nor with the private purchaser,
but sell to the factors, or middle men. A factor sees all their
stocks, selecting from each to compose his own, and so offers a
better variety to the shopkeepers throughout the kingdom than
could otherwise be done. There are in Birmingham about fifty of
such factors. But the line of demarcation is somewhat indefinite,
because many of them manufacture certain specialities for themselves.
Still the system is the best under present circumstances,
and works on the whole to the mutual good of all parties. The
factors in London, and merchants generally, are also large
purchasers from Birmingham manufacturers. The Post Office is
the chief engine of distribution for small parcels, and all <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>little
orders and repairs. Two private firms, however, do a considerable
business by collecting, through agents, in London, Coventry, and
Birmingham, small jewellery parcels, conveying them by rail, and
then delivering them very quickly and cheaply in those towns.
The losses are practically nil, although perfect shoals of such little
packages are despatched and delivered daily by these means,
together with the railways.</p>

<p><b>Lighthouse Apparatus.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. Kenward</span>].&mdash;(B. 153).
The Lighthouse Works of Chance Brothers and Co., Spon Lane,
near Birmingham, are the only works of the kind in the kingdom.
The improvements since 1865 may be noted under: (1) the optical
agents, (2) the lamps and burners with the illuminant or fuel used
in them, (3) the mechanical appliances. The six original orders of
optical apparatus distinguished by their radii and height are no
longer the only types. There is the hyper-radial first order lens,
whose focal distance is 1,330 millimetres, and diameter about 104¾
inches, the usual first order being about 72½ inches diameter, and
there are several varieties below the 6th order whose radius is 150
mm. Of these the Ship Light introduced by Messrs. Chance with a
focal distance of 125 mm., is the most important. Various new
arrangements of condensing lights where from one flame, certain sea
sectors are strongly illuminated by means of vertical prisms, while
other sectors are less intensely lighted, have been adopted with
signal success, as have also several special designs where a coloured
and a white beam of equal intensity are concerned. The new lenses
for port and harbour lights, and those used with the electric arc on
board vessels of war for search purposes, introduced by Messrs.
Chance, may be named. The present two most powerful lights in
the world are the Macquarie at Sydney Heads (a revolving electric
light of the first order) and the Tino near Spezia, a revolving
electric light of the second order. In both a single optical agent is
employed, and carbons from 15 to 25 mm. diameter. Another improvement
is the ship light lens designed to give adequate intensity
and penetrating power in a vessel’s signal lights, especially her side
lights, whereby an increased luminous range can be secured and the
risk of collision greatly lessened. The vertical angle subtended by
lenticular refracting apparatus has been increased from 45° and 47°
to 80°, and even by the use of dense flint glass to 92°. In this way
the normal power of the central or lens portion of a light, always
two-thirds of the whole power, has been so augmented that it is found
advisable to dispense with the prisms both upper and lower, and to
depend on the refractors alone. When higher degrees of intensity
are needed, a second tier of lenses can be superposed on the first,
and a third and fourth added, a separate flame being in the focus of
each tier. This has been done by Mr. Wigham, of Dublin, with
gas flames, and by Sir James Douglas with oil flames. The two
great divisions of lighthouse apparatus into fixed sections and revolving
sections have been extended. Thus the old fixed light, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
revolving light with equally recurring single flashes, the composite
fixed and flashing light, always objectionable from its unequal power,
have been supplemented by the occulting light, and the group flashing
light which last was designed by Dr. John Hopkinson, and first
constructed by Messrs. Chance. In this arrangement the beams are
sent out in groups, each beam of the group being separated from one
another by a short interval of time, and each group by a longer interval.
The lights on a coast can thus be distinguished by their
single flash, double flash, or triple flash.<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Illuminants and Burners.</span>&mdash;Mineral oil has been
introduced, and special burners designed in order to burn it. The
largest of the old colza oil burners (known as Fresnel burners) has
an intensity of 230 candle units, or 23·6 candle units per square inch,
while a similar burner for paraffin has been reported as affording
415 candle units, or 44·3 units. The latest developed Trimley
burner of Sir James Douglas, with nine concentric wicks, gives 49·8
units. The oil used has a flashing point of 154° F. The average
cost of mineral oil is one-fourth that of vegetable oil. Gas is also
freely employed, and in the 108-jet burner of Mr. Wigham it has
attained a power of 2,433 candles, and in the 10-ring burner of Sir
James Douglas, a power of 2,619 candles. Beyond the highest reach
of oil or gas burners, say 2,500 or 2,600 candles, is the electric arc
giving an intensity of beam of ten millions of candles. At the other
end of the scale is the duplex burner, which, with the new Chance
lenses, is available in the smallest apparatus for a horizon of from
seven to ten miles.</p>

<p>The Spon Lane Lighthouse Works have been extended greatly
since the last visit of the Association. The unique methods of
grinding and polishing the optical glass have not been materially
changed, but the number and variety of machines have been largely
increased. In the mechanical shops there is now a complete
<i>outillage</i> for turning, drilling, shaping, screwing, &amp;c., applicable to
all the old designs and processes, and also the newer branches
introduced since 1865. There are about 200 workpeople employed,
many with consummate skill and intelligence, as may be assumed
from the precise and highly finished work in which they are engaged.</p>

<p>At this date about 260 complete sea lights and about 300 complete
harbour lights have been sent out, together with about 200 smaller
port lights and about 370 of the recently designed ship lights.</p>

<p>Very striking specimens of optical science have been contributed
by Messrs. Chance, as exemplified in the list of dioptric lights they
have supplied around our own coasts, of which The Longships, the
Wolf Rock, the Flamborough Head, the Hartland Point, the Start
Point, the South Stack Rock, The Casquets, Bull Point, Anvil
Point, the Eddystone, and many others are examples.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Kenward will be glad to give further information to any
member of the Association who may take an interest in the subject.</p>

<p><b>Locks and Lock Making.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. C. Tildesley.</span>]&mdash;(B. 77.)
The price of cheap padlocks is still lower. Iron padlocks
of the cheapest class are now being made in this district (Willenhall)
and delivered free in Bombay and Calcutta, at <i>fivepence halfpenny
per dozen</i>!</p>

<p>In reference to the table (B. 89), the number of employers may be
set down as 100 less (that is 350) and at least 1,000 must be deducted
from the total number of workpeople, bringing it to about 3,950.</p>

<p>The production of locks in the district may now be computed at
25,000 dozens per week, as against 31,500 dozens per week, as
estimated in 1865. The reductions being chiefly in the pad, cabinet,
chest, and till departments, which are being driven hard by America
and continental competition. On the other hand, door locks (rim,
dead, mortice, and drawback) are being made in larger quantities
than ever, and are being sold at prices which would have been
regarded as fabulous twenty years ago.</p>

<p>The average earnings of locksmiths are 15 to 20 per cent. less than
the figures given at (B. 89.) American competition in castings has, so
far as the lock trade is concerned, considerably diminished since
1865. By grinding English sand to the fineness of flour, and by the
adoption of Plaster of Paris moulds and improved methods of casting,
transatlantic supremacy over England no longer prevails. While in
the matter of cheap and clear castings they have maintained for their
productions the reputation for practical qualities which has so long
distinguished them. Artistic design and ornamentation have improved.
Germany is now the most formidable rival to the English
lockmaker, owing to the low wages and long hours endured by the
German locksmiths. The remedy for this state of affairs ought, in
the interests both of commerce and humanity to be found not in a
retrograde movement on the part of England to Germany, but in the
uprising of the German workman, to secure the same <i>status</i> as that
enjoyed by his English confrere.</p>

<p><b>Magic Lantern Slide Painting.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">H. H. Stanton.</span>]&mdash;The
old fashioned method of tracing from a drawing or
engraving though still used, has given way to a great extent to the
introduction of photography. Special drawings are made, photographed
on to glass, and subsequently painted. Girls and also
artists are employed in the work. Photographic slides from various
parts of the world come to Birmingham to be finished.</p>

<p><b>Measuring Rules and Tapes.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">John Rabone.</span>]
(B. 628.) It is noteworthy that in the “garret” at Heathfield Hall,
near Birmingham, where Watt amused himself during the latter
years of his life with his copying machines&mdash;the prototypes of those
afterwards known as the American and Enfield&mdash;is still to be seen an
example of Watt’s early work in London before he entered upon his
remodelling of the steam engine in connection with Matthew Boulton.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>In one of the drawers there are preserved several of the old
fashioned tools, formerly, and still used in rule making by hand,
and also carefully wrapped up in paper by Watt himself, is a “brass
sector with a French joint,” which, unlike his compasses and other
mathematical instruments, has undergone no wear, and is as
faultlessly clear and perfect as it was on the day it left the maker’s
hands. The only assumption that can be made respecting it is
that it is the identical “brass sector with a French joint,” of which
young Watt so glowingly wrote to his father, now a hundred and
thirty years ago; and if that be so, it is the only known specimen
of the great engineer’s work as a rule maker.</p>

<p>Prior to the last meeting of the British Association in Birmingham,
in 1865, machinery had been brought into the trade to but a small
extent compared with what has since been the case in the making
and marking of all kinds of rules. Accurately engine-divided, 2-feet
folding steel rules, retailed at a shilling each, are a new feature of the
trade, which is a boon to mechanics they never before had. The
employment of automatic machinery has quite revolutionised the
trade, by bringing larger capital into it, and increasing the number of
workpeople sixfold, at the same time enabling employers to pay
higher wages than they could possibly do when all depended upon
unaided hand labour. The trade has always been in comparatively
few hands, three-fourths of the names appearing in one directory as
makers, being merely dealers, or journeymen; in one case fifteen of
the men so described being merely journeymen of one employer. The
bulk of the trade is now in the hands of as few makers as might be
counted on the fingers of one hand, but competition is not rendered
thereby less severe, but is rather more excessive. During the past
twenty years a great change has taken place in many countries by
the adoption of the metre as a standard measure. Since 1870 all
the numberless measures of little German towns, many with both
decimal and duo-decimal divisions, have been abolished, and the use
of the metre alone legalised. Other nations have followed the
example of Germany. Many of the rules made for export to such
countries as Russia, which have not legalised the metre, are marked
with it in addition to the local measures, thus preparing the way for
its future adoption. Its use has been legalised in Great Britain,
though not made compulsory, and many of the measures made for
export to foreign countries where English customs prevail are
marked with both English and metrical divisions.</p>

<p><b>Military Arms Trade.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. D. Goodman.</span>]&mdash;(B. 381.)
At the date of the notice of the gun trade, published in the transactions
of the meeting of the British Association held in Birmingham
in 1865, the British forces were armed with muzzle-loading guns.
The arm of the service was that known as the “Enfield Rifle.” It
was adopted by a committee of military officers, appointed by Lord
Hardinge, Master General of the Ordnance, in 1853.</p>

<p>In 1865 the breech-loading system was receiving much attention.
The Wesley Richards’ Breech-loader had been for some time in us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>e
in the service on an experimental scale, and had been tested in the
field, both in China and New Zealand. So far back as 1861, a
thousand breech-loaders, on Terry’s principle, had been issued to
the troops, but did not prove successful. Trial was also made of
Sharp’s American Breech-loading Rifle. The successful use of the
Needlegun Breech-loader, by the Prussians, in the Danish war of
1864, gave great urgency to the enquiry.</p>

<p>In August, 1864, the English Government invited proposals for
the conversion of the Enfield rifle into a breechloader. Fifty
different systems were sent in, of which five only were ultimately
selected for trial. Four of these were capping and one was a non-capping
arm&mdash;that is, one in which the cartridge carries its own
ignition. On 14th March, 1865, the Woolwich Committee issued
their Report on the various systems which had been submitted,
in which after speaking of the obvious disadvantages which a
breechloader requiring a cap presents, when contrasted with one
adapted for a cartridge carrying its own ignition, proceeds to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Committee have now respectfully to submit their observations
on the whole question.</p>

<p>“The ultimate armament of the infantry with breech-loading
weapons is determined upon. It would be done at a comparatively
small cost by conversion, but it is now well known that
the calibre, twist, and form of rifling of the ‘Enfield’ is not the
most favourable for fine shooting, and it is quite certain that no
converted arms can possess the precision which will be easily
attained in a new breechloader of smaller gauge and quicker
twist. Nor will the soldier be able to carry that increased
quantity of ammunition, which is so desirable, without a
reduction of calibre.</p>

<p>“There are certain circumstances in which, notwithstanding all
the inconveniences which will attend the co-existence of
unaltered arms, converted arms, and new arms, with their
different ammunitions, it may still be desirable to proceed with
the conversion on the ground of its small cost, and of the less
time in which the arms can be turned out; but the Committee
do not feel in a position at present to recommend such a
measure.”</p></div>

<p>In the end, the economical view prevailed, and it was determined
to convert the Enfield rifles to the Snider system. The effect of this
decision was to postpone to 1871, when the Martini rifle was
adopted, the advantages recognised in the Woolwich Report, which
would be obtained by a smaller bore, quicker twist, and a different
form of rifling.</p>

<p>In July, 1866, the Birmingham Small Arms Company was
instructed to proceed with the conversion of the Enfield rifles to
breech-loaders to the full extent of their power. The London Small
Arms Company was very shortly afterwards established. They
received similar instructions. The result was that the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Enfield rifles available were converted, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Enfield rifles converted" class="max30">

  <tr>
    <td></td><td class="tdr border-top">537,552</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>As this number was insufficient for the requirements of the
service, and as it was indispensable that there should be but one
description of arm in use, it became necessary that new Sniders
should be made. In 1869, and subsequently, orders were issued to
the trade, and the following supplies were made:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Snider arms supplied" class="max30">

</table>

<p>Making a total of 875,437 Snider arms.</p>

<p>The adoption of the Martini-Henry rifle resulted from an invitation
to inventors, issued by the War Department first in 1866. More
than 100 different arms and 49 descriptions of ammunition were sent
in, but the committee appointed to make the selection reported
that none came up to the requirements. The invitation was
repeated in December, 1867, resulting in 45 additional arms being
submitted. In February, 1869, the Committee reported recommending
a combination of the Martini Breech Action and the Henry
rifling, and for the ammunition, the Boxer coiled case. During the
following year, trials of this arm were made in the service, and
finally, in 1871, it was definitely adopted. Orders were afterwards
issued to the trade, and the following statement shows the numbers
which have been manufactured at the Government Factory, and by
the trade, up to March, 1885:&mdash;</p>

<p>It has now (July, 1886) been decided to adopt a new arm,
embodying the improvements suggested by the experience gained
in the use of the Martini, during the service it has undergone. It
has been found that the calibre of the barrel if still further reduced
would much improve the shooting, an increase being made at the
same time in the twist of the rifling. A Committee has for some
time past had the matter under consideration, and finally have
recommended an arm which is to be known as the Enfield-Martini.</p>

<p>In the new arm, the Martini action is retained, the outside
dimensions of the barrel are the same, but the bore is reduced
from ·45 inch to ·4 inch. While the twist of the rifling is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>creased
from 1 turn in 22 inches to 1 turn in 15 inches. The weight of the
bullet is reduced from 480 grains to 384, the powder charge being
the same as in the former rifle, 85 grains. A wooden hand guard
is fixed over the breech end of the barrel to protect the hand of the
soldier when the barrel becomes heated by rapid firing. The barrel
is no longer imbedded in the fore-end of the stock; it was found that
the exterior of the barrel was liable to rust from contact with the
wood. The fore-end is now so shaped that the barrel simply lies upon
it, held in place by the bands which surround both stock and barrel.
The back sight is provided with a wind gauge, and a locking bolt
secures the trigger when the arm is at full cock. A sword bayonet
is substituted for the former triangular-shaped bayonet. A “quick
loader” will be used with this arm. It hangs on the side of the
body of the action, and holds six cartridges. The cartridges are acted
upon by a spring which forces the head of the cartridge through an
aperture in the lid, ready for the soldier’s hand. With this “quick
loader,” six rounds can be fired in about 25 seconds, whereas, in
loading from the pouch, 40 seconds are required. This description,
of the new arm may be subsequently modified, as the recommendation
of the Committee has not yet been confirmed.</p>

<p>As it is essential that all arms made for the service should be
interchangeable, the orders to the trade have been confined to the
factories where the work is done exclusively by machinery, viz., to
the Small Arms Company and National Arms Company in Birmingham,
and to the London Small Arms Company, whose works
are at Bow. The National Arms Company, which was incorporated
in January, 1872, is no longer in existence, having gone into
liquidation in December, 1882. With a paid up capital of £330,000
they erected gun works at Sparkbrook, and ammunition works at
Holdford. The gun works have now been purchased by the
Government, and the Holdford Works are on the market for sale.
The same irregularity in the Government employment, which proved
fatal to the National Arms Company, acted very prejudicially for
both the other Companies. The Birmingham Company paid no
dividend during the five years 1879-83, and a nominal one only in
1884.</p>

<p>To this uncertainty of Government employment may be attributed
the difficulty of obtaining swords and bayonets, to which, a short
time since, attention was called in Parliament. When military
arms were supplied by the ordinary hand-made trade, there were
four bayonet-makers in Birmingham and West Bromwich, where,
now, there is not one; and in Birmingham there is only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
manufacturer of swords, when formerly there were several. The
manufacture of triangular bayonets has been, with trifling exceptions,
confined of late to Enfield, while sword bayonets, not made at Enfield,
have been procured from Solingen. The future Enfield-Martini is
to be provided with a sword bayonet. The plainly expressed wish
of the House of Commons is that in future, all swords and sword
bayonets shall be made in England, of English material. There
will not be the slightest difficulty in carrying out this wish. Birmingham
will be able to produce any number that may be wanted,
but to keep together the required staff of workmen it is necessary
that the demand should be continuous.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of rifles, as well as bayonets, there is every
reason to hope that the future employment of the trade will be
more regular and continuous. The past bitter experience has shown
that the trade cannot live without steady employment, and it is now
fully recognised that it is not desirable that this country should
remain dependent for its supply of arms on one Government
manufactory at Enfield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ammunition.</span>&mdash;Up to the present time the English Government
have adhered to the use of the Boxer cartridge, the case of which is
made up of thin coiled brass, attached to an iron base, which carries
the ignition. For some years past all other European nations have
used a solid metal cartridge case, <i>i.e.</i>, a case in one piece stamped
out of a flat disc. The English Government have now decided that the
solid case shall be used, with the new Enfield-Martini rifle. A plant
for the manufacture of these cartridges is being prepared at Woolwich.
It is fully intended also to employ the trade. Orders have already
been issued to the Birmingham Small Arms Company and Messrs.
Kynoch and Company, Birmingham, and Messrs. Eley Brothers, of
London, who have all had long experience in the manufacture of this
description of cartridge.</p>

<p><b>Nails (cut).</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">R. F. Martineau.</span>]&mdash;(B. 613). The
machines for cutting tacks and small nails up to 1½ inch are now fed
automatically. One unskilled workman can keep five or six machines
going. The machines do not work so fast as the hand fed, but there
are fewer stoppages, and the quantity turned out is greater. This
improvement has reduced the price 30 per cent. The present
machines turn out the work so that it need not be looked over and
sorted as was formerly the case. The cut nail trade has developed
in the North and at the present time, there are as many nails made
at Leeds as at Birmingham. The better class of nail is, however,
supplied from Birmingham. London brewers send coasting vessels
up the east coast with cargoes of stout, and they return from Hull
with cut nails at very low freight. The quantity of nails made in
Birmingham is about the same as in 1865. The French and Belgians
have given up making cut nails, but they make tacks. No French
tacks or <i>tingles</i> (the smallest sort of tacks used in the shoe trade) are
now imported into England, on the contrary, some are being exported
into France.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>Mild steel has been introduced since 1865. Steel nails are now
being made at only a shilling per cwt. above the price of iron nails.
These steel nails will clench, and hence are replacing wrought nails.</p>

<p>The manufacture of wire nails has been introduced into Birmingham
since 1865. On its introduction, wire was imported from Germany
and Belgium, owing to its cheapness and low freight, but now, as
English wire has fallen in price, it is used in preference to the foreign.</p>

<p>Wire nails are suited for hard wood, hence a large trade is done
in them in Australia. The Cape, India, and South America, are
markets for Birmingham nails. Women get about ten shillings a
week. Youths as feeders about 15 to 20 shillings, skilled mechanics
from 30 to 50 shillings, and labourers 15 to 20 shillings per week.</p>

<p><b>Needles and Fish Hooks.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. M. Woodward.</span>]&mdash;(B. 197).
The pointing of needles is now done exclusively by
machinery. The new machines introduced into the trade within the
last 25 years, are the machines for cutting, *pointing, *skimming,
stamping, eyeing, *point handing, *tempering, scouring, *handing,
*counting, heading and tailing, blueing, *burnishing, *finishing,
assorting, and sticking. The machines marked with * produce not
only cheaper, but better quality of work. Electro-gilding has taken
the place of the old ether gilding. As regards machinery used in
the production of sewing machine needles, the chief novelty is the
“grooving” machine, which is taking the place of the old stamping
process. From special enquiries made I conclude that in the needle
district the weekly productions of all kinds of needles and goods
akin to needles, cannot be less than 50,000,000 in number. <i>Pins.</i>
In addition to pins in ordinary use, steel and glass headed pins are made
at Redditch, the weekly production of all kinds of pins being about
two tons. An attempt is being made to adapt the machines for the
production of two pins at a time instead of one. <i>Fish hooks and
fishing tackle</i> are now made almost entirely by machinery. Artificial
fly making is altogether done by hand; feathers of various birds
are used for “sea flies.” Spinning baits are shaped much like
the bowl of a spoon, and are electro-plated so as to cause a glittering
appearance when in motion. Swivels in connection with these
baits form a branch industry, and machinery for the dressing and
turning of these has of late been introduced.</p>

<p>The manufacture of fishing rods is now an important branch.
Among the new aids to production are the turning machine and the
machine for splitting bamboo canes for the manufacture of “split
cane” rods. These curious and costly articles first came from
America, and the making of them by hand requires the greatest
patience as well as the highest skill in joining, every part of the rod,
from the butt to the thinnest member, having to be split lengthwise
into six pieces, each wedge-like in section, and then glued together
again with the greatest care and exactness. Reel making has been
introduced of late years. One manufactory turns out about 50 dozen
rods, 7,000 floats, 13,000 flies, 4,000,000 fish-hooks, and 5,000
swivels per week. Electro-tinning is now used for small sea-hooks.
The weekly production of fish-hooks is approximately 20,000,000.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Nickel, Cobalt and German Silver.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Alfred
S. Johnstone.</span>]&mdash;(B. 673.) Many of the original sources of nickel
have become exhausted. It is now found plentifully in Norway (in
magnetic pyrites, containing about 4 or 5 per cent.) Hungary still
supplies ore. The South African supply of ore, (an arsenide of over
25 per cent cobalt) has fallen off. South America and her desert of
Atacama was a great source of nickel or cobalt, some of its hydrated
arseniates reaching as much as 25% in the ores of nickel, and 17% in
the ores of cobalt. The sole mine in Connecticut has been worked
for many years. Sweden has yielded nickel from the Klefra and
other mines. Germany supplies nickel from the Mansfeld mines.
About 1874 nickel was discovered in the Island of New Caledonia,
and large quantities of the ore were shipped to this country and to
France. There appears now to be a constant supply from this source.
The ore is a double silicate of nickel and magnesia, averaging 7 to
10% nickel. Later still nickel and cobalt have been discovered
in Nevada. Passing over the history<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> of the production of nickel,
which is already, to some extent, described in “Birmingham and
Midland Hardware District,” it should be mentioned that nickel,
though brittle under the hammer, has been successfully rendered
malleable by treatment in which manganese is employed. The
process of rendering nickel malleable is due to Messrs. Wiggin &amp; Co.,
who patented the process in 1880. About the same time Dr.
Fleitman, in Germany, succeeded also in rendering nickel malleable
by using magnesium instead of manganese. The nickel thus
produced may be rolled into plates and drawn into wire, or be
stamped, beaten or raised into any article of common use, and it
may be welded to itself or to iron. It is less malleable when it
contains carbon than when pure. Besides its application for the
production of German silver, nickel is largely used as anodes for
nickel plating, and for coinage in many countries. Its oxide is used
in the Potteries for giving a soft brown tint to china and earthenware,
and it is also employed for the production of nickel salts for plating.
The German Government in 1873 adopted nickel alloy for coinage,
and the exceptional demand advanced the price from 4/- to 16/- per
lb. At the present time, owing to the extensive supplies from all
parts of the world, and the keen competition in the trade, nickel is
reduced to 2/- per lb.</p>

<p>Cobalt has scarcely any application; it is used as an anode in
plating, and for some parts of scientific instruments. It does not
whiten copper to the same extent that nickel does. The oxides of
cobalt are of great value in the arts, not only for the production of
the beautiful blue colours given to china, earthenware, and glass, but
also as a basis of the blue pigment known as cobalt blue. The oxide
of cobalt was in 1841 40/- per lb.; to-day it is about 8/- per lb.
Latterly there is a tendency to replace brass and electro-plate by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
white alloys which have nickel for their basis. Spoons, forks,
fittings for railway and ship fittings, bar fittings, and harness
furniture have been largely manufactured from these metals. These
alloys are known under various names, such as silveroid, argentoid,
navoline, nickeline, aluminium metal, &amp;c., but they are all varieties
of German silver, containing in some cases small proportions of tin,
lead, cadmium, and other metals.</p>

<p><b>Papier Mâché Trade.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">E. H. Hodson</span>].&mdash;(B. 566).
Within the last few years wood pulp imported from Sweden has been
introduced as a substitute for paper pulp, and is used for small desks,
work boxes, jewel cases, and many other articles, thus enabling
Birmingham manufacturers to compete with Chinese and Japanese
lacquered goods. A change too has taken place in the mode of
ornamentation. Instead of employing artists at a high rate of wage,
transfers are used which can be applied to the articles by boys and
girls. German papier mâché is imported into this country duty
free, but on the other hand, English papier mâché is subjected to
heavy duties before it reaches the German and Continental Markets.
It should be mentioned that there still continues a steady demand
for small quantities of expensive articles made of papier mâché,
though for the supply of the Million, the old papier mâché is replaced
by the Swedish pulp above referred to.</p>

<p><b>Pewter &amp; Britannia Metal Trade.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">W. Perks.</span>]&mdash;(B. 617).
The two trades are distinct. Pewter consists of 95
parts tin, 4 parts copper, and 1 part antimony. The metal is cast
in iron or brass moulds. Britannia metal is not cast, but rolled,
stamped, swaged, or spun. Its composition is similar to pewter, but
a little more antimony and copper and less tin. The staple articles
in pewter are still ale and wine measures, tankard and drinking cups,
the most saleable shapes are identical with those which Hogarth
painted in the early part of the last century. There has been a
revival of pewter for ink pots for Board School use and home use.
In foreign markets a tea-pot known as the Dutch pattern is still sold
of the same shape, style, and strength as it has been for the last 70
years. Makers have tried to introduce wrought metal pots instead
of cast pewter, but the foreign traders do not care for them. The
trade in beer engines and bar fittings has much increased within the
last 20 years.</p>

<p><b>Plate, Crown, and Sheet Glass.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Henry
Chance.</span>]&mdash;(B. 147.) In the 1864 report it was mentioned that
cast plate glass is manufactured at Smethwick (Plate Glass Company)
crown, sheet, and rolled or rough plate glass at Smethwick (Messrs.
Chance Brothers and Co.) and at Stourbridge (Stourbridge Glass
Company.) Of these three manufacturing establishments, that of
Messrs. Chance Brothers and Co. is the only one now in operation.
Antique glass for decorative purposes and glass shades are manufactured
at Oldbury by Messrs. W. E. Chance and Co. Crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
glass is now almost extinct; Messrs. Chance however still make the
very limited quantity required. The price of ordinary sheet glass
has fallen from one shilling and twopence per foot in 1884 prior to
the repeal of the duty, to three halfpence in 1886. Rolled plate
glass is now made by most of the manufacturers of sheet glass, and
by several firms who confine themselves to this branch of trade.
The Siemens’ regenerative furnace has not only been successfully
applied to furnaces containing pots, but by its aid Messrs. Siemens
have been able to dispense with pots and employ large tanks made
of clay, for the melting of glass. By this means the process of
melting and working becomes continuous. The raw materials are
introduced at one end of the tank furnace and arrive, after gradual
transformation, at the other end, in the shape of melted glass.</p>

<p><b>Plated Wares.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Elkington and Co.</span>]&mdash;(B. 477.)
A great impetus has been given to the trade owing to the development
of hotel life in London and all large towns, together with the
equipments required for ocean-going steamers, in many cases special
designs having reference to the building being required. On the
other hand the taste of the public is now for simple and useful
designs. The old form of stamping, in which the stamp was lifted by
one or more workmen, has been superseded by the method described
on <a href="#Page_172">page 172</a>. A dish cover which formerly required hundreds of blows
now requires only six, and instead of the old process of smoothing
the surface with hammer and stake a “wheeling” machine is used,
and the swage or shape lapped over instead of mounting with a wire,
the time consumed being about one twentieth part of that required
by the old process. Improvements in metals used enables the
hollow bodies of coffee and tea services to be “spun” (see <a href="#Page_174">page 174</a>)
instead of being slowly raised into form by wooden mallets and steel
hammers. Spinning oval bodies is now extensively practised,
though at one time it was considered impossible to treat German
silver in this way. This process (oval spinning) is used only when
one or two articles of a particular shape are required. When great
numbers are required stamping is the process adopted. Press work
in shaping articles has considerably improved, and has replaced, to
some considerable extent, the tedious process of chasing and
embossing. Enamelling has been introduced, but owing to Japanese
competition the trade is gradually falling off. The enamelling,
known as cloisonné is performed as follows: The decoration, birds,
flowers, &amp;c., is traced on the surface of the object to be enamelled,
very thin wire of any metal, but generally silver or copper, is then
bent by hand to the various forms traced on the metal. This process
requires the utmost care. The wire thus bent is then soldered
down to the surface of the object, the different colours put in in the
form of paste into the different divisions formed by the bent wire,
and the whole is subjected to intense heat until the colours are
completely fused. When cold the surface is rubbed down flat, and
finally polished. In the champlevé process the spaces for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
colours are cut out with a graver. The process of damascening
largely carried on by Messrs. Elkington is described at (B. 545.)
Soldering arrangements are much improved, the introduction of the
patent blowpipe saves time, and the workman is able to solder,
cleaner and produce a firmer jointing than with the old process.
The sand blast is a new feature in the finishing department.</p>

<p><b>Refrigeration.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">S. Puplett.</span>]&mdash;Mechanical refrigeration
owes its development to the enterprise of Birmingham
men. The imports of ice into the United Kingdom were in 1884
nearly 300,000 tons. Refrigerating machinery is supplying ice in
competition with these importations. In addition, refrigerating
machinery is used in brewing for the purpose of cooling wort
quickly, in bacon curing, in working of butter and butterine, cocoa,
and candles, in oil refining and tar distilling, and in telegraphic
works for securing a low temperature when testing cables. Freezing
machines have too been used in sinking and tunnelling, the water
being prevented from running into the shaft owing to the hardening
of the earth by freezing. The cost of imported ice may be taken as
20/- per ton, while machine ice can be made for 5/- per ton. The
first commercial machine, patented by James Harrison, of Geelong,
in 1856, was an ether machine, and made in London. Afterwards
machines of this kind were made by Mr. Philips, of the Atlas Works,
in Oozells Street, Birmingham. In 1861 Carré showed the
advantages of ammonia over ether as a refrigerant, and since then
Mort and Dicholle, of Sydney, and Stanley, of London, have
patented various modifications of the Carré system. Pictet has
devoted many years to the subject, and has identified himself with
sulphurous acid as a refrigerant, and recently claims to have
discovered a fluid termed <i>liquide Pictet</i>, SCO₄; in addition to these
refrigerants, air, water, chloride of methyl, bisulphide of carbon,
carbonic acid, and nitrous oxide have been used. The machines
made in Birmingham by the Birmingham Refrigerating Company
are ammonia machines. This form of machine consists of (1) a
multitubular vessel called the refrigerator, containing liquid
(anhydrous) ammonia&mdash;in this vessel vaporization takes place; (2)
a vapour pump, by which the ammonia formed by evaporation
is exhausted from the refrigerator, compressed, liquefied, and forced
into (3) the condenser, consisting of a multitubular vessel surrounded
by water; (4) a circulating pump for supplying the condenser with
water; (5) ice tanks surrounded by a bath of a liquid of a low
freezing point, such as a solution of chloride of calcium or of common
salt; (6) a circulating pump for circulating the brine through the
refrigerator and around the ice tanks; (7) the steam engine or other
motor for driving the vapour and circulating pumps.</p>

<p><b>Rope Making.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. T. Wright.</span>]&mdash;(B. 578). Within
the last few years a machine has been introduced by Mr. Good, an
American, for treating fibres as imported, more particularly Manilla.
By means of fluted rollers, and a system of bars fitted with strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
steel pins which press upwards into the hemp, the fibres are dressed
and straightened out, the operation is aided by a patented machine
known as Wright and Laider’s Patent Sun and Planet Hacklebus.
Finally, the hemp fibres are drawn off the pins and delivered in a
compact and continuous sliver into a can placed in front to receive it.
These slivers being in one length, are now passed on to the drawing
frames to be accumulated together.</p>

<p><b>Steel Pen Trade.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Maurice Pollack.</span>]&mdash;(B. 634.)&mdash;There
has been little improvement since 1865. Muffles heated
by gas on the plan of Dr. Siemens, have been introduced for
tempering and colouring, and ordinary gas is also used in connection
with these processes, but these improvements are only used by one or
two firms, and more as a matter of convenience than as a means of
making pens of a better quality or lower price.</p>

<p>Many patents have been taken out since 1865 for new styles of pens,
the most successful have been those which deal with the points; these
have been turned up or turned down, thickened, or planished, all for
the purpose of producing smooth points to glide freely over paper
even with a rough surface. The fashion in paper and ink materially
influences the style of pens. The J pens (so called because that letter
was embossed upon one of the first and best known broad points)
have been extensively used, and have influenced hand writing,
especially that of ladies. Calligraphy as an art has fallen off in this
country, and this has influenced pen manufacture. The most
delicately made pens are manufactured for foreign use. There are,
perhaps, not so many pen works now as there were in 1865, but the
productive power has vastly increased. The present <i>weekly</i> average of
pens manufactured is about 160,000 grosses, requiring from 16 to 18
tons of steel, of which only 8 tons appears in the article, the rest
being loss or waste. Pen steel is still produced in Sheffield, the best
being made from Swedish iron. The number of girls and women
employed is from 3,200 to 3,600, whilst the number of men employed
as tool makers, rollers, engineers, stokers, &amp;c., hardly exceeds 500.
The increase in make since 1865, of quite 60 per cent. is mainly due
to the export trade. No new pen manufactories have been established
since 1865, except in the United States, where there are now four pen
works, but of these, only one is of importance. In France, there are
now only three pen manufactories, and the production is less than it
was three years ago. In Germany there is only one, and its make
though improved in quality is very inconsiderable in comparison with
the large consumption of steel pens in Germany. An attempt has
been made to establish works in Russia, where the duty on steel pens
is high, but after existing one or two years, the manufactory was
burnt down, and no attempt has been made to re-build it. The Customs
duty on steel pens with the exception of Russia, are the United
States, where it is 6d. per gross, is very moderate, and prevents the
importation of low and middle class pens. The price obtained for
steel pens depends more upon the reputation of the maker or of t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>he
mark than upon their intrinsic value, hence the difficulty of giving
an average value of each gross of pens produced.<a name="FNanchor_58_59" id="FNanchor_58_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><b>Stourbridge Fire Clay.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">George King Harrison.</span>]&mdash;(B.
133.) The district suffers from high railway rates. The
quantity of clay raised per week now is about 3,500 tons, say 160,000
tons per annum. About 40 million bricks are made per annum.</p>

<p><b>Salt.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. H. Hollyer.</span>]&mdash;(B. 138.) At the Stoke
Prior Works from 500 to 700 hands are employed. The salt manufactured
is from 3,000 to 4,000 tons per week. The entire produce
of salt in Worcestershire is about 250,000 tons per annum. The Brine
pits are about 1,000 feet deep. “Butter salt” is largely exported
from Droitwich to India and Australia. Round pans have been
introduced since 1865. The aggregate traffic, that is, coal received
and salt forwarded, of the Stoke Prior works is about 1,000 tons per
day.</p>

<p><b>Swords and Matchets.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">F. M. Mole, Jun.</span>]&mdash;(B.
649.) The conventional ideas as to the extent of the sword trade
are very erroneous. Our army is small and only horse soldiers and
officers carry swords. When once equipped one single sword forger
will produce what is required. Hence the matchet trade is combined
with sword manufacture. (The matchet is a large knife used in sugar
cultivation in the West Indies and Central South America.) The
extraordinary demand for swords at the time of the Crimean war, and
the inability of English firms to supply it, gave the start to foreign
competition. It is not generally known that the larger proportion of
the officers’ swords sold in this country are either German swords
imported complete or foreign blades mounted in London. There
have been several spurts in the trade, but these died out, and at the
present time Messrs. Robert Mole and Son, of Birmingham, are the
only manufacturers who take Government contracts. An outline of
the method of manufacture is given in (B. 649) and is similar to that
of edge tools generally&mdash;(see <a href="#Page_208">p. 208</a>). In ornamenting the hilts of
swords fire or mercury gilding<a name="FNanchor_59_60" id="FNanchor_59_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> is used. The “gripe” is of wood
(walnut or beech), and covered with dog fish skin.</p>

<p><b>Tin Plate Ware.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">A. N. Hopkins.</span>]&mdash;(B. 638.)
Fifty years ago workmen made a variety of articles with several
pieces of tin plate soldered together. The introduction of machinery
in the trade is reducing the number of skilled workmen. In 1835-6
Mr. Thomas Griffiths took out a patent for stamping and burnishin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>g;
shortly afterwards Mr. J. H. Hopkins commenced the manufacture of
“Patent tea-pots.” Candlesticks and other articles made in the same
way quickly followed, and stamping and burnishing opened up
possibilities which till then had not been dreamed of in the trade.
In 1840 what was thought a monster stamp was put down to stamp
the top of an 18-inch imperial dish cover. Further improvements
in stamping led to the trade being speedily one of the most important,
both in this town and the neighbouring one of Wolverhampton.
A little time later, tin plate workers turned their
attention to the stamping of a few culinary articles, such as colanders,
gravy strainers, &amp;c., and of wash-hand basins. In the making of
these sheet iron was used, and the articles when finished were tinned
by the same process as that used by tin plate makers, and were then
sold as “tinned wrought iron hollow ware,” and once more an increasing
impetus was given to the trade. Milk pans and “prospecting”
pans were made in this way, and the advance made just
at this time by the Australian Colonies on the great discoveries of
gold opened out a large field, where the goods have been bought in
ever-increasing quantities, while shortly after, the Cape and South
America as well as Canada became large customers for a similar class
of goods. India too came into the market for brass and copper
articles, while Egypt, especially about the time of the American
Civil War, began to be a most important customer for the copper
utensils hitherto manufactured only by the natives, but which the
superior machinery the English manufacturer possessed, enabled
him to produce much better and cheaper. Meanwhile the French
Exhibition of 1855 had shown to our manufacturers specimens of
stamping superior to anything they could produce, and one or two
unsuccessful attempts were made by them to obtain a nearer inspection
of the French method of stamping or more properly
pressing. In one way and another it leaked out that the French
makers employed a pressure plate and a gradual forcing process,
instead of the sharp blow by which the English stamper pounded
his material into the required shape. The late Mr. Clutton Salt
purchased the patent right for this country, and in 1867 a machine
was in operation at the works of the Birmingham Enamel Co., with
which Mr. Salt was at that time connected, and Messrs. Griffiths
and Browett took out a licence to use the patent. Improvements
in stamping followed, keeping well abreast of the new process,
and ultimately outstripping it, especially as regards size of vessel
produced.</p>

<p>The French system of pressing was taken up in the United States,
and as early as 1865 the works of Lalance and Geoschein, at
Woodhaven, New York, were in active operation on this principle.
In 1866 a Birmingham man, named W. Page, son of an old
Birmingham worthy, travelled to New York, and erected improved
machines on the French system in the factory of Messrs. Ketcham
and Co. These machines economised material, and at the same
time quickened production.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1872 Mr. Satchell Hopkins, of Birmingham, after communication
with Mr. Page, put down a number of machines on Mr. Page’s
principle, including one which is even now the largest and most
powerful of its kind. A similar form of machine was adopted by
other firms, and there soon followed an extraordinary development
of the trade hitherto known as the “Stamped Tin Hollow-ware,”
but now as the “Pressed Bright Tinned Hollow-ware” Trade.</p>

<p>In another important branch of the trade, though there has not
been so much scope for improvement, advance has not been wanting.
The common and ugly japanned ware, in which stencil plates were
largely used, has been superseded by “transfers,” and by an
invention of Mr. Alfred Hopkins, the japanning of articles with
backgrounds highly polished has been superseded by a dead,
morocco-like surface, in low tones of pleasing appearance.</p>

<p>In iron plate working the only new mechanical appliance introduced
since 1867 is a machine or series of machines for making
buckets, by which the article is practically made in one operation.
The low wages of workmen who make buckets, coupled with the
low prices to which manufacturers have been driven by excessive
competition, render the employment of these machines of doubtful
advantage. Besides Birmingham, manufactories are established in
Wolverhampton, London, Reading, Sheffield, and other towns.</p>

<p><i>Treatment of Waste.</i>&mdash;The following facts are supplied by Mr. T. J.
Baker:&mdash;Sheet iron scrap and lathe turnings are worked up again
into sheet iron. Copper clippings and turnings are remelted.
Copper scale is resmelted, as also brass clippings and brass dust.
Gold scrap of the japanning department is sent to the gold refiners,
and the leaf metal scrap to the bronze powder manufacturers. Tin
plate scrap, after the larger pieces have been sold to the button
makers, are “stripped”&mdash;that is, the tin is removed by immersion in
hydrochloric acid. The resulting tin salt is used by calico printers.
The iron scrap, after removal of the tin, is used for precipitating
copper by the wet process. Tin oxide, known as “drop tin,” formed
on the surface of the metal in the tinning pot, is, after recovery of
as much of the tin as possible, sent to the tin smelter. Galvanizing
dross, an alloy of zinc and iron, which sinks to the bottom of the
galvanizing bath, is removed by a perforated ladle, and refined by
distilling off the zinc. Zinc ashes, that is cinders which have fallen
on the molten metal and absorbed zinc, is also refined by distillation.
Flux skimmings, or that which is skimmed off from the galvanizing
bath, is an oxide and chloride of zinc. This is put in a vat; stirred
with hot water, the oxide falls to the bottom of the vat, but the
chloride dissolves. The clear solution is heated with gas liquor,
when zinc precipitates as carbonate, and the chloride of ammonium,
now in solution, is recovered by evaporation. The solid residues are
worked up in paint mills into zinc white.</p>

<p><b>Tools (Heavy Edge).</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">A. Winkler Wills.</span>]&mdash;(B. 656.)
In addition to edge tools proper, such as axes, adzes,
hatchets, and other articles, the trade includes picka<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>xes, spades,
shovels, forks, hoes, augers, trowels, shipscrapers, &amp;c. The number
of patterns regularly supplied by the manufacturers of Birmingham
and the neighbourhood is estimated at several thousands, each nation
and almost each district requiring special patterns of its own. The
character of the soil, habit of people and other circumstances affect
the form of tool though used for the same purpose. The enormous
hoe, with a blade nearly a foot wide and of the same depth, which is
in universal use in Guatemala, would be useless in Valparaiso, because
the soil is light in one country and heavy in the other.</p>

<p>A Brazilian axe is made thus:&mdash;A piece of bar iron is taken and
the middle part thinned out under a light steam hammer to the thickness
required to form the edge of the tool. The blank is then
doubled over upon itself and the bottom part welded together. A
bar of hard cast steel is welded on to the bottom of the blank;
the steel being then cut off from the bar to a width corresponding to
that of the blank. The embryo axe, by means of a steam hammer,
is forged under tools of suitable shape fixed in the head of the
hammer, the final shape being given by hand tools. The tool is
now ready for hardening and tempering&mdash;the steeled end of the
axe is heated to a blood red in a slow furnace and is then plunged
into cold water. It is now tempered by slowly heating till it assumes
the required tint. The tool is now ready to be ground, polished on
a succession of wooden wheels or bobs, dressed with emery of
gradually increasing fineness, and then to have its upper part
japanned black, blue, scarlet, or bronze-coloured, according to the
taste of the consumer.</p>

<p>The principal machinery employed consists of shears, “squeezers,”
tilt and trip hammers, striking from 200 to 400 blows per minute,
steam hammers, shearing and punching machines, stamps, rolls, and
lastly, massive machines or presses of various construction, used for
shaping the eyes of hoes, pickaxes, &amp;c. The wood handles required
for spades, shovels, &amp;c., form a distinct branch of the trade. Hickory
handles are almost exclusively used in the wedge axes so largely
employed in India and the colonies; these handles are necessarily
imported from the United States. Self-acting machines have during
late years been introduced for the turning of ash handles for axes,
hatchets, &amp;c. The handles of spades, shovels, and forks are of ash
sawn from planks, subsequently turned in lathes. To bend them,
they are steamed and pressed into shape by powerful screws.</p>

<p>The only waste products are the scale or dross which falls from
the heated iron, and the shearings or scraps cut off the tools.
Both are sold to the ironmaster&mdash;the former for fettling his furnace,
the latter to be worked up again into bar iron.</p>

<p>The number of persons employed in the trade in Birmingham and
the district is probably 3,000 to 4,000.</p>

<p>The conditions of the manufacture have been greatly altered
during the last seven years by the extensive introduction of machinery
to replace manual labour; at the present time a much larger number
of boys and youths are employed than was formerly the case. Their
wages range from 8s. to 15s. per week according to age. Forgemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
earn on an average £2. 10s. or £3. per week; foremen smiths about
£2., and their strikers or underhands about £1. to £1. 5s, when in
full work. Women are only employed in japanning, wrapping up
and similar light work. The revolution which has taken place in
the method of manufacture during recent years was largely accelerated
by the tyrannical operations of the formerly powerful trades
union of edge-tool makers, which, during the period of large demand
which prevailed from 1872 to 1874, used every available means to
limit production, and to make it impossible for the manufacturers to
execute orders in reasonable time. As a consequence, the productive
power of the trade has been so enormously increased that at
present it is altogether disproportionate to the demand, and hence,
in this as in almost every other branch of manufacture, unremunerative
prices and reckless competition are unfortunately the order of
the day.</p>

<p><b>Umbrellas and Parasols.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">William Holland.</span>]&mdash;(B. 666).
Since the previous article was written machinery has been
extensively introduced, an umbrella rib being now made by automatic
machinery in one operation instead of several. The square or round
iron wire for the stretcher is also similarly converted into form nearly
ready for japanning. In some cases, even the riveting or attaching
the rib to the stretcher is done by machinery, but as yet the experiment
remains to be proved good and economical. The number of
hands employed has increased. Some hundreds of men, women,
girls, and boys are employed. The materials have undergone a
change, zinc and iron have displaced to a large extent brass and
copper, and great competition has caused everything to be lightened
and cheapened; but a reaction is taking place in this respect, and
better and stronger goods are coming into use. The various parts of
umbrellas and parasols are now gilt, bronzed, enamelled, silver and
nickel-plated, instead of being simply japanned as was the case
formerly. The patents which have been taken out in connection with
umbrellas and parasols are numerous, and in many cases trivial. Over
800 patents were granted between 1867 and 1876, and since then the
inventive ball has been rolling still more rapidly. It has been
proposed to use a transparent material to enable one to see ahead
when protecting the face with the umbrella. Another arranges for
spinning the umbrella so as to drive off the rain, other proposals are
to fold the umbrella so as to go inside a stick, to convert it when
necessary into a railway carriage key, a corkscrew, or a pike, writing
materials have been inserted in the handles, and a variety of contrivances
proposed. One of the most curious of all these patents is one
for fixing the umbrella to the hat somewhat after the fashion of the
thatched Indians of whom one reads in books of travel.</p>

<p><b>Watch Manufacture.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">R. L. Bragge.</span>]&mdash;The
“watchmakers” of Birmingham of forty or fifty years ago were
rather repairers than makers, though there was scarcely a part of the
mechanism of a watch which they were not at times obliged to make.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Of these watchmakers, S. Allport, of Bull Street, was considered to
take the lead. There were also T. Warwick, in Colmore Row;
Birley, in High Street, and others. At this time the highest class
watches were made in London. Liverpool also had a reputation for
goods of high quality. Coventry, however, enjoyed a larger
industry than either of the other centres named. The first earnest
and persistent effort to include watch manufacture as a Birmingham
industry was made by Messrs. Hodgkins and Booth, who commenced
about 1843, and continued till 1850, when Messrs. Betts and
Fairfax succeeded to the business. Messrs. Charles Wood and Sons,
of Bath Street and of St. Paul’s Square, not long afterward gained a
reputation as manufacturers of high quality watches. Mr. W.
Ehrhardt, in 1873, erected a large manufactory for production of
watches according to modern ideas, and the English Watch
Company (Limited) have also erected extensive ranges of shopping
in Villa Street. Exclusive of “jobbers,” there are probably about
600 to 700 artisan watchmakers employed in the town, about 30 per
cent. of whom are females; some 500 of these are employed at the
two large manufactories just mentioned. It is probable that nearly
700 watches per week are turned out in Birmingham. Birmingham
watches have a good reputation, and there is not a “duffer” watch
turned out from one year’s end to another.</p>

<p>One singular feature of the trade is that the name of the maker
rarely appears on a watch&mdash;manufacturers generally put on the names
of their customers. Many large export houses have adopted fictitious
names, under which a certain pattern watch has attained a reputation
that makes the name a valuable property. A large Colonial
trade is done on these lines.</p>

<p>Messrs. Dennison, Wigley, and Co., manufacture watch cases,
employing about 100 hands, making the cases for American companies.
These cases as well as many Swiss ones pass through the Birmingham
Assay Office, and are afterwards sent abroad for the
movements to be fitted in. Since this practice prevailed, it is obvious
that the Assay Office returns are no index of the number of watches
made in this town. Almost the only branch of this trade which is
not localised is the enamelling and painting of the dials. Watch
glass making is scarcely practised in this country, nearly the whole
supply of the watchmaking world coming from the Continent.</p>

<p><b>Wire Working.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">J. B. Gausby.</span>]&mdash;(B. 596.) No
marked departure from processes previously described has taken
place. More attention is now paid to decoration, and there is an
endeavour to introduce more artistic designs. The large demand for
wire netting made by machinery as described (B. 597) has led to a
wide extension of locality for its manufacture. Large wire drawing
firms and galvanizers in different parts of the country have taken up the
manufacture, so that although Birmingham still turns out a large
quantity of the article, she has not been able to retain the manufacture
within her bounds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Wire (Steel).</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Charles Lean.</span>]&mdash;(B. 591.) One
hundred years ago a horse was employed for drawing wire by a firm
in the town. New applications of wire within recent years have
been telephones, deep sea sounding, road and aerial tramways, and
cycles. The scrap wire is utilised for nails; it is also bought by
hawkers for the purpose of making riddles and a number of wire
articles. No women or girls are employed in the trade of the
district, and perhaps about 700 men and boys, the bulk of whom
draw iron wire only.</p>

<span class="smaller">GEOLOGY AND PHYSIOGRAPHY.<br />
(BIRMINGHAM DISTRICT.)</span></h2>

<p class="author">EDITED BY PROFESSOR CHAS. LAPWORTH, LL.D., F.G.S.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3><a name="PHYSIOGRAPHY" id="PHYSIOGRAPHY"></a>PHYSIOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p>The town of Birmingham lies almost in the exact
geographical centre of England and Wales, midway between
sea and sea. Its distance in a straight line from
the three nearest sea-ports on the opposite sides of
the island, Liverpool, Boston, and Bristol, is about
85 miles in each case, while its distance from London
and Southampton is only a few miles more.</p>

<p>The main watershed of Southern Britain, which commences
to the northward in the Pennine Range and
divides the rivers which flow eastward into the German
Ocean from those which drain westward into the Irish
Sea and the Bristol Channel, enters upon the Birmingham
District from the northward by way of Cannock Chase,
crosses the “Black Country” about six miles to the west
of Birmingham, and passes out of the district to the southward
through the Lickey Hills, round the headwaters of
the Avon to the Edge Hills and the Cotswolds.</p>

<p>The town of Birmingham and its immediate neighbourhood,
is drained by the brooklets which unite to form the
river Tame, the first of the southern tributaries of the
Trent. Thus, physiographically speaking, Birmingham
lies well within the basin of the Humber. To the
west of the watershed of Dudley and the Lickey, the
rivers of the district have a short and rapid descent to the
main stream of the Severn; to the south eastward, they
glide gently across the Midland Plain to its tributary&mdash;the
soft-flowing Avon.</p>

<p>The physical centre of the district is the locality of
Barnt Green, a point on the Midland Railway, about
eight miles to the south of the town. From this po<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>int
radiate the several low hill ranges which give to the
neighbourhood of Birmingham its distinctive character.
The first of these ranges (forming the main watershed,
and constituting the natural backbone of the area) is
composed of the Lower Lickey Hills and their northerly
extensions&mdash;the rolling heights of Halesowen, the conspicuous
mound of Rowley Regis (820 feet), and the
beautifully wooded heights of Dudley Castle (730 feet),
the Wren’s Nest, and Sedgley Hill. To the west of this
axial ridge, a second range bearing points of a somewhat
greater elevation, stretches from the same locality of
Barnt Green through the Upper or Bromsgrove Lickey
Hills (900 feet) to Hagley, where it is known as the
Clent Hills (1,028 feet). These look out far and wide over
the beautifully fertile valley of the Severn, and are
continued to the north-westward in the heights of Stourbridge
and Abbots Castle. To the east of the main
Lickey and Dudley axis, the country is less conspicuously
diversified. The hill-ranges are broader, and rise
almost imperceptibly from the surrounding plains. The
most important of these less elevated areas forms what may
be termed the Birmingham plateau. This is an irregular
strip of broken ground, about twenty miles in length by
four or five miles in breadth, which takes origin from the
north-eastern slopes of the Lickeys between Northfield
and Halesowen, and sweeps northwards through Harborne,
Birmingham, Barr and Sutton Park, into the wild district
of Cannock Chase. On this irregular plateau stand the
town of Birmingham and its suburban villages of Harborne,
Edgbaston, Moseley, Aston, Handsworth, and Sutton
Coldfield. The western side of the plateau overlooks
the “Black Country.” It is marked out by the terrace of
Smethwick, Sandwell, and Great Barr, and culminates
in the conspicuous fir-topped hill of Barr Beacon (800 feet).
The eastward margin of the plateau is much less pronounced,
and subsides gently into the great Midland plain
of Warwick and Tamworth, along a line drawn from
Northfield, through King’s Heath, Moseley, Camp Hill,
and Sutton Coldfield.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>The ground forming the Birmingham plateau rises and
falls into an endless succession of heights and hollows;
here sinking down into broad tree-sheltered, stream-cut
valleys, there rising into long low mounds and hills. The
subsoil throughout is mainly gravel or sandy clay, and the
underground drainage is, as a rule, excellent. The north-western
half of the plateau still retains its original forest
character, and the primeval aspect of the district is recalled
by the wild area of Sutton Park&mdash;a picturesque
admixture of long, dry, pebbly mounds, covered with
thick woods of oak, ash and holly, and divided from each
other by open glades of gorse patches, with long, flat, treeless
expanses, shrouded in dark heather and picked out here
and there with deep, clear water-pools. The central half
of the plateau is now covered by the great town of Birmingham
and its immediate dependencies. The town
stands upon a series of broad rounded knolls, divided
from each other by intervening open valleys. The more
elevated points are marked by the church of St. Philip’s,
Newhall Hill, Soho Hill, and the Monument; while the
great maze of streets, manufactories and commercial
buildings fill up all the space between. Strictly speaking,
the town proper lies in the angle included between the
river Tame and its little tributary the Rea. The Tame
runs in a broad valley round the north-eastern side of the
town to the low-lying district of Saltley, and thence
takes its course north-eastward across the Midland plain
towards the Trent at Burton. The little river Rea, which
is the Birmingham river par excellence, runs from the
Lickey Hills through the south-eastern corner of the town,
across the low-lying district of Digbeth, and joins the
Tame at Saltley.</p>

<p>The south-western portion of the Birmingham plateau
is occupied by the fashionable district of Edgbaston and
the neighbouring suburbs of Harborne and Moseley.
While the original upland character of the plateau is still
distinctly apparent, the dwellers in this southern area have
in all other respects utterly changed its former aspect.
The land has been reclaimed and enclosed. In place of
the wild oak and ash, we have masses of the Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>an
elm, the fir and the beech; and in place of the wild heather,
cultivated lawns and grassy fields. Every advantage has
been taken of the natural resources of site and soil; and
the result is that Edgbaston and its surroundings form
one broad expanse of mansions, woods and fields, well
worthy of the town and neighbourhood.</p>

<p>To the westward of the Birmingham plateau lies the
district of the “<i>Black Country</i>,” of which the town of
Dudley is the natural centre. Compared with the Birmingham
plateau, it is a lowland district of wild confusion&mdash;a
maze of mines, chimneys, factories, and straggling
villages and towns, shrouded in a canopy of smoke and
steam. The natural soil is generally hidden from sight by
heaps of mining spoil, and mounds of rubbish, cut
through in all directions by lines of railway and broad
canals. The beautiful wooded hill of Dudley, crowned
with its grey keep, and the neighbouring oak-clad ridges
of the Wren’s Nest and Sedgley, rise like islands of verdure
out of the dark sea of mining ground around, and look
strangely out of place amid their gloomy surroundings.</p>

<p>To the east of the Birmingham plateau lies the broad
plain of Tamworth and Nuneaton, watered by the sluggish
stream of the Tame. The plain is continued far to the
southward through the richly wooded district of Warwick,
Alcester, and the old Forest of Arden, and thence down
the valley of Shakespeare’s Avon, to the terrace of the
Edge Hills and the northern slopes of the Cotswolds.</p>

<p class="author">BY PROF. C. LAPWORTH, LL.D., F.G.S.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h5>

<p>The Birmingham district, or that area of which
Birmingham constitutes the natural capital and commercial
centre, extends from Stafford on the north to Tewkesbury
on the south, and from Wellington on the west to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Leicester on the east, forming an area about 60 miles in
length by 50 in breadth.</p>

<p>In no single district in Britain is the relation of the
physiography of the country seen to be more strikingly
dependent upon its geological structure than within the
limits of the Birmingham district. Every hill, ridge, plain,
and valley of any importance is a mere reflex of the underground
geology. The local distribution and physical
peculiarities of its rock formations afford a natural and
complete explanation of all its special scenic peculiarities.</p>

<p>The dominant geological formation of this Midland
area is the great Mesozoic formation of the <i>Triassic</i> or
New Red Sandstone, which stretches through Southern
Britain in a continuous band from Hartlepool to Exeter,
and divides the broken and contorted Paleozoic rocks of
the west from the flat-lying Neozoics of the east. This
great band of New Red Sandstone attains its widest
extension in the north of the Birmingham district, between
Eccleshall and Charnwood Forest, where its transverse
diameter is about 50 miles. Within the limits of the
Birmingham district, however, its diameter rapidly decreases,
until in the extreme south, in the neighbourhood
of Worcester and the Malverns, its breadth is reduced to
about 10 miles.</p>

<p>The red rocks of this <i>Triassic</i> formation not only form
by far the most predominant and most conspicuous
geological feature of the district at the present time, but
not long since, geologically speaking, they must have
extended over the entire area in one unbroken expanse.
They now constitute a sheet of red sandstones and
marls, through which protrude, in numerous bands and
patches, the older Paleozoic rocks. Although nowhere
very steeply inclined, these red beds of the <i>Triassic</i> have
been bent into several long low arches, or broad domes,
whose longer axes range approximately north and south.
The summits of many of these arches have been denuded,
and the underlying older rocks have again been bared
to-day. Four of these arches are especially conspicuous,
those of the Wrekin, Malvern, Dudley, and Nuneaton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
In each of these the underlying <i>Coal Measures</i> are laid
bare, forming the four coalfields of Coalbrookdale, Forest
of Wyre, South Stafford, and Eastern Warwick, all of
which shew round their outer margins a narrow band of
the intermediate formation of the <i>Permian</i>. In each of
these anticlinals, too, the denudation of the core of the
arch has been sufficient to wear away the <i>Carboniferous</i>
from its centre, and to expose to view yet older formations&mdash;the
<i>Old Red Sandstone</i> in the Forest of Wyre, the <i>Silurian</i>
in South Staffordshire, the Malverns, and Coalbrookdale,
and even the <i>Upper Cambrian</i> and its underlying igneous
rocks in the Wrekin, the Lickey, and near Nuneaton. With
the exception of the <i>Silurian</i> of Abberley and Dudley, and
the recently discovered <i>Cambrian</i> of Nuneaton, however,
these <i>pre-Carboniferous</i> rocks are comparatively inconspicuous,
rising up merely in narrow bands in the cores of
long wedge-shaped hills.</p>

<p>From the economical as well as from the structural point
of view, by far the most important of these geological
arches is that of South Staffordshire, which is the southward
continuation of the Pennine chain, and part of the
true backbone of Southern Britain. The central axis of
this arch runs, as we have seen, through the Dudley Hills,
and dies away in the complex of faults to the south of the
Lickeys. On the natural consequences of the rise of this
arch, all the physical, scenic, and economic peculiarities of
the central parts of the district are essentially dependent.
The hills and plains around Birmingham are all more or
less related to this grand anticlinal&mdash;the hills marking
the uplifted edges of the harder rocks, the limestones, sandstones,
and pebble beds; and the plains, the position of
the gently inclined soft shales and marls. It has brought
within workable distance of the surface the coals and ironstones
of South Staffordshire, and the valuable limestones
of the Dudley Hills, and it has had its final effect in bringing
together the overflowing population of the town and
district.</p>

<p>The original simplicity of the geological structure of the
floor of the Birmingham District is much complicated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
fractures, faults, and unconformities. The Wrekin and
the Malverns are both affected by profound dislocations.
The South Staffordshire Coldfield is bounded both on the
eastward and the westward by faults of more than ordinary
magnitude, while a long straight fault more than 20 miles
in length runs through the south-eastern part of Birmingham
itself, and flings down the <i>Keuper marls</i> of the Warwick
plain against the older sandstones of the Birmingham
plateau.</p>

<p>In the Birmingham District as everywhere in Britain,
the <i>Triassic</i> formation rests unconformably upon everything
below. At the same time, its members overlap each other
more or less irregularly, and shew a rapid diminution in
thickness when followed from west to east. Thus it
happens that not only do the <i>pre-Triassic</i> rocks make their
appearance in their expected positions along the main
anticlinal lines, but many of the old ridges of Palæozoic
rocks, which rose out of the Triassic waters, have had their
enveloping pall of red sandstone removed from their flanks
and summits, which have thus been bared once more to the
light of day. Such are, in part, the ridges of the Wrekin, the
Malverns, the Lickeys, and the Forest of Charnwood.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Severn, to the west of Birmingham,
the strata run in narrow bands. The central portion of this
valley lying between Coalbrookdale and Bridgnorth, to the
west of the main anticlinal of the Birmingham district,
owes all its striking beauty and variety to the rapid alternations
of hard and soft strata which occur within its
limits.</p>

<p>In the great Midland plain to the east of Birmingham,
the strata are spread out in broad sheets. The plain is
underlain in great part by the comparatively homogeneous
flat lying Keuper marls, with their intercalated bands of
harder sandstones. Its scenery is consequently less varied
than that of the Severn valley, but it is rich in that sweet
sylvan beauty which is almost peculiar to the English
landscape, and it forms one broad expanse of gently
rolling farmland and woodland, whose green crested waves
sweep onward to the east and south, mile beyond mile, ti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>ll
they break against the long shore-like scarp of the harder
Jurassics.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Local Rock Formations.</span></h5>

<p>As will be apparent upon a study of the accompanying
geological map, the geological formations exposed within
thirty miles of Birmingham, include the entire stratigraphical
succession between the <i>Cambrian</i> and the middle
portion of the <i>Jurassic</i>, with two notable exceptions. The
two formations locally wanting are the <i>Ordovician</i> and the
<i>Old Red Sandstone</i>. The nearest known <i>Ordovician</i> rocks
occur in central Shropshire, to the east of Church Stretton;
the nearest <i>Old Red Sandstone</i> beds are met with to the
south of the Forest of Wyre. The natural sequence of formations,
and the localities where the several formations are
most conspicuously displayed, are given in the following
table:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Fundamental Crystalline and Volcanic
Rocks of the Malverns, the Wrekin, And
Charnwood Forest.</span></h5>

<p>The rocks which undoubtedly occupy the lowest place
in the geological formations of the Birmingham district
are those crystalline and partly schistose masses which
form the core of the Malvern Hills; and certain well-marked
volcanic rocks which occur at the Wrekin and Nuneaton,
and which appear to have their equivalents in the great
igneous series of Charnwood Forest. That all these
more or less crystalline rocks are of higher antiquity than
the Upper Cambrian of Wales is demonstrated by the
fact that fossiliferous rocks containing Cambrian fossils of
this age overlie them, while the lowest recognisable zones
of these overlying fossiliferous rocks (the Hollybush sandstone
of the Malverns, the quartzite of the Wrekin, and the
Hartshill quartzite of the neighbourhood of Nuneaton)
are in part composed of their fragments. Whether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
however, they belong in part to the Middle or Lower
Cambrian, or wholly appertain to the earlier formations of
the Archean, must as yet remain an open question.</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <span class="smcap">Malvern Hills.</span>&mdash;The core of the Malvern
Hills is composed of a coarse syenitic, and more or less
gneissose rock, pierced by veins of quartzo-felspathic rock
of igneous origin (Hereford Beacon, &amp;c). The main mass
which is coarsely crystalline, becomes occasionally distinctly
gneissose and even schistose, and its mineral bands
strike from north-west to south-east, <i>i.e.</i>, transverse to the
general trend of the Malvern Ridge. The basement
beds of the Hollybush sandstones (Cambrian) and the
Llandovery rest unconformably upon this rock, which has
consequently been claimed by some geologists as distinctly
of Archean age, representing in part the Laurentian of
Logan.</p>

<p>The best localities for studying the essential characters
of the Malvern rocks are the quarries of the North Hill
and the Wych, and the eastern slopes of the hills between
Malvern Wells and Herefordshire Beacon.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <span class="smcap">The Wrekin.</span>&mdash;The core of the beautiful hill of
the Wrekin is formed by a magnificent series of highly
acidic volcanic rocks&mdash;rhyolitic lavas and ashes. As first
pointed out by Dr. Callaway, they rise out unconformably
from below fossiliferous rocks of Upper Cambrian age.
(Hollybush Sandstone and Shineton Shales) and are believed
by him to be of Archean age. The finest exhibitions
of the volcanic ashes of the group are met with in quarries
on the flanks of the Wrekin itself, while the rhyolitic
lavas occur in scattered localities along the hill. A broad
mound of the same igneous series rises out from below
the Triassic to the south of Walcot Station, and a most
beautiful and instructive section of banded and spherulitic
rhyolites is shewn in the quarry at the locality known as
the Lee Rock.</p>

<p>The truly volcanic nature of these remarkable rocks
was first pointed out by Mr. S. Allport, F.G.S., and their
original characteristics, and the changes they have undergone
since their formation, have been described by him in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
well-known series of memoirs. Their geological position,
and their relation to the associated fossiliferous strata,
and to the similar rhyolitic rocks of Caer Caradoc and
Pontesbury have been fully discussed by Dr. C.
Callaway, F.G.S.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) <span class="smcap">Nuneaton</span> (<span class="smcap">Caldecote Hill</span>).&mdash;A thin group of
volcanic breccias and tuffs, with associated quartz-felsites,
and diabase, rises out from below the Upper Cambrians
of Nuneaton, in the Park of Caldecote Hill. The
lowest zone of the overlying Cambrian Hartshill quartzite
is in part composed of their fragments. The ashes are
shewn in old cuttings to the north-west of Caldecote
Lodge, the quartz-porphyries and diabase in an old
quarry about a quarter of a mile to the southward, while
the breccia composed of the fragments of these old rocks,
in the base of the Cambrian quartzite is best shewn on the
tramway still farther to the southward, leading down to the
Coventry Canal.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) <span class="smcap">Charnwood Forest.</span>&mdash;This district is formed of
an island of ancient igneous and stratified rocks rising out
from below the Upper Trias. The stratified rocks are
almost wholly composed of materials of volcanic origin,
and shade off on the one hand into coarse volcanic
agglomerates, and on the other into fine green slates like
those of the Borrowdale series in the Lake District, to
which indeed the whole of the bedded Charnwood rocks
bear a striking resemblance.</p>

<p>The stratified volcanic rocks are pierced by numerous
igneous intrusions. The most conspicuous are those
classed by Professor Bonney, F.R.S., as syenite. These
are most conspicuous near Groby, Bradgate, and generally
in the south eastern parts of the Charnwood area. A
mass of beautiful hornblendic granite rises through the
Trias immediately to the east of Charnwood Forest at
Mount Sorrel, near Barrow on Soar. A few later dykes
of altered andesite occur within the forest itself, and
diorite in the outlier of Brazil Wood.</p>

<p>To the south of Charnwood Forest, several remarkable
points of syenitic rock protrude through the flat-ly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>ing
Trias. The most conspicuous of these are the hills
of Sapcote, Croft, and Enderby.</p>

<p>There is no direct evidence of the Cambrian or pre-Cambrian
age of the Charnwood rocks, but strata identical
with the fossiliferous Stockingford shales (Upper Cambrian)
of Nuneaton, have been pierced in several borings through
the Trias near Leicester, Market Bosworth, etc., and
appear to rest at once upon the Charnwood rocks, as do
the Nuneaton beds upon the Caldecote volcanic group.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Cambrian Rocks.</span></h5>

<p>No fossiliferous strata unequivocally of Lower Cambrian
age occur within the limits of the Birmingham District;
but strata of Upper Cambrian age are met with in several
localities. They were first recognised by Professor
Phillips in the area of the Malvern Hills, and have been
subsequently detected within the last few years at the
Wrekin, at Nuneaton, and in the Lower Lickey Hills.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malvern Hills.</span>&mdash;The Upper Cambrian beds of the
Malverns rest upon the crystalline rocks of the axis of the
hills to the south of Herefordshire Beacon, along the
slopes of Midsummer Hill and Keys Hill. The lowest
zone is the <i>Hollybush Sandstone</i>, a light green micaceous
rock, containing tubes of sea worms and <i>Kutorgina
cingulata</i>.</p>

<p>The Hollybush Sandstone is succeeded by shivery
shales, somewhat sandy below, and becoming darker and
more carbonaceous above.</p>

<p>In their lower beds they yield:&mdash;<i>Obolella Salteri</i>,
<i>Obolella sagittalis</i>, <i>Lingula pygmea</i>, <i>etc.</i> In their middle
beds they afford <i>Pellura scarabeoides</i>, <i>Spheropthalmus
alatus</i>, <i>Agnostis pisiformis</i>, <i>Agnostus trisectus</i>, etc., well-known
fossils of the Upper Lingula Flags (Dolgelly) of
North Wales.</p>

<p>Their highest beds contain <i>Dictyonema sociale</i>, a fossil
which passes up into the succeeding Tremadoc Slates.</p>

<p>The rest of the local succession of the Cambrian rocks
is hidden by the unconformable overlap of Silurian.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p>The Hollybush Sandstone and the overlying sandy
shales contain numerous intercalated volcanic rocks, some
of which are of the age of the surrounding strata, while
others are intrusive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nuneaton District.</span>&mdash;In the neighbourhood of the
town of Nuneaton in eastern Warwickshire, a strip of
Cambrian rocks, about eight miles in length by one in
breadth, has been detected within the last few years. The
rocks consist of volcanic ashes, quartzites and thin-bedded
shales, pierced by dioritic dykes. These strata were
formerly mapped as altered Millstone Grit and Carboniferous
shale, and their Cambrian age has only been
recently demonstrated by the discoveries of Birmingham
geologists. The complete succession is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) <span class="smcap">Caldecote Volcanic Group.</span>&mdash;Well-bedded tuffs
and volcanic ashes (see <i>ante</i>) with masses of Quartz-felsites
and diabase.</p>

<p>(2.) <span class="smcap">Hartshill Quartzite.</span>&mdash;Thick-bedded quartzites,
with occasional layers of sandy shale.</p>

<p>(3.) <span class="smcap">Stockingford Shales.</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <i>Lower Division.</i>&mdash;(<i>Obolella Beds</i>) Purple and green
shales with <i>Obolella Salteri</i>, <i>Lingulella pygmea</i>, <i>Lingulella
lepis</i>, <i>Acrotreta</i>, <i>Protospongia</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <i>Upper Division.</i>&mdash;(<i>Agnosias Beds</i>) Grey and black
shales with <i>Agnostus pisiformis</i>. <i>Beyrichia Angelini</i>
and <i>Lingulella Nicholsoni</i>, in the lower zones, and
<i>Spheropthalmus alatus</i> and <i>Dictyonema</i> in the upper zones.</p>

<p>These Cambrian rocks are overlain unconformably by
the Coal measures to the west, and by the Keuper beds
to the east; the boundary of the area is, however, locally
defined by lines of fault.</p>

<p>The basement beds of the Hartshill Quartzite are
locally composed of fragments of the underlying volcanic
rocks (Caldecote Beds). The Quartzite itself, which forms
the chief road metal of the neighbourhood, is laid bare in
a long series of quarries between Nuneaton and Hartshill.</p>

<p>The overlying purple and green shales of the Stockingford
Beds range from Marston Jabet, south of Chilvers
Coton to Atherstone Outwoods. The best section is seen
in Parley Park Lane near Atherstone, and the fossils h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>ave
been obtained from this section, from Atherstone Oakwoods,
Camp Hill, and Marston Jabet.</p>

<p>The best section of the succeeding grey and black
Shales occurs in the cutting of the Midland Railway near
Stockingford, which gives its name to the formation. Their
fossils have been procured from the rocks of this section;
from the cutting at Chilvers Coton, the banks of the
Coventry Canal, from Oldbury reservoir, Mawbornes and
Merevale Park.</p>

<p>The numerous intrusive dykes of volcanic rock form a
conspicuous feature in the geology of these Cambrian
strata. They are formed of coarse-grained diorites,
much quarried for road metal, kerbs, and setts. Good
sections occur in the quarries near Tuttle Hill, in the
railway cuttings near Stockingford and Chilvers Coton,
and in quarries near Oldbury Reservoir.</p>

<p>A small patch of these Nuneaton Cambrians is met
with on the north-western margin of the East Warwickshire
coalfield, at Dost Hill, to the south of Tamworth. It
consists of the usual annelide-bearing Stockingford Shales,
pierced by an intrusive mass of diorite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lower Lickey Hills.</span>&mdash;The core of the Lower Lickey
Hills between Barnt Green and Rubery, about eight miles
south of Birmingham, is formed of a mass of quartzite
identical in all its main features with that of Hartshill,
near Nuneaton.</p>

<p>At the village of Rubery, in an exposure on the roadside,
it is seen to be unconformably overlain by
fossiliferous Llandovery sandstone, the basement beds of
which contain fragments of the underlying quartzite in
abundance. At the south-western extremity of the Lower
Lickey Range the quartzites contain fragments of igneous
rocks, and appear to pass down into a series of felspathic
grits, pierced by dioritic dykes similar to those of the
Nuneaton District. Good sections of the quartzites are
laid bare at Rubery Station, at the village of Rubery, and
in a large quarry near the roadside, a mile northward
from Kendall End. In the last-named locality the
quartzites are seen greatly folded and faulted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wrekin District.</span>&mdash;In the Wrekin area the great
volcanic series of the hills is immediately overlain by a
quartzite similar to that of the Hartshill and the Lickey,
the basement bed similarly containing fragments of the
underlying volcanic rocks. The quartzite is succeeded by
the Hollybush sandstone, with its characteristic fossil,
<i>Kutorgina cingulata</i>.</p>

<p>A broad area, lying between the Hollybush sandstone
and the unconformably overlying Silurian rocks of Buildwas,
is occupied by a series of Upper Cambrian rocks,
denominated by Dr. Callaway the Shineton Shales, and
characterised by the forms:&mdash;<i>Olenus Salteri</i>, <i>Sphæropthalmus</i>,
<i>Asaphellus Homfrayi</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>, <i>Bryograptus Callavei</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, allying them with the Tremadoc Beds of North Wales.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Silurian Rocks.</span></h5>

<p>The rocks of the Silurian System are fully developed
within the limits of the Birmingham District,
under their most typical aspect. The well known
localities of Dudley and Barr have been famous in
the geological world since the publication of Murchison’s
great work, the Silurian System; and the abundance
and beauty of the fossils of the limestone rocks of the
district place it next to the typical area of Central
Shropshire as the representative country of the Silurian
rocks.</p>

<p>The Silurian strata are all of the well-known Salopian
type, shewing several thick-bedded limestones, occurring
on distinct horizons in a great thickness of dark blue or
grey nodular shales and mudstones. They make their
appearance in sharp anticlinal arches in the South Staffordshire
coalfield, and along its faulted margins. Four of
these exposures occur along the crest of the Lickey-Dudley
anticlinal&mdash;at Rubery, Dudley Castle Hill, the
Wren’s Nest, and Sedgley. The largest continuous exposure
is that near the town of Walsall, on the eastern
margin of the coalfield.</p>

<p>All the Silurian formations from the Mayhill Sandstone
to the Ludlow (Aymestry) Limestone are recognisable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
but the terminal Downton sandstone is lost below
the unconformably overlying Carboniferous. None of the
localities, however, shew the complete consecutive series,
which is made out by piecing together the sections
occurring in the several areas.</p>

<p>(1.) <span class="smcap">Lower Lickey Hills.</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <i>Landovery or Mayhill Rocks.</i>&mdash;The usual red and
grey <i>Pentamerus</i> sandstone of the Mayhill formation is
exposed along the north-west flank of the Lower Lickey
Hills. It may be seen resting unconformably upon the
Cambrian quartzite in the village of Rubery, and at Leach
Heath. Casts of fossils are abundant in some of the
sandstones a few feet above the base of the formation,
and include the well known forms:&mdash;<i>Pentamerus oblongus</i>,
<i>Pentamerus lens</i>, <i>Strophomena expansa</i>, <i>Attrypa reticularis</i>,
<i>etc.</i>&mdash;These may be collected from the rocks at the village
of Rubery, and from the fragments of sandstone
scattered over the fields between the Asylum and Leach
Heath.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <i>Woolhope or Barr Limestone.</i>&mdash;The Llandovery
sandstone is followed (in a stream section below the
Asylum) by pale blue shales and mudstones containing
a bed of hard calcareous rock, affording examples of
<i>Illenus Barriensis</i>, <i>Atrypa reticularis</i>, <i>Encrinurus
punctatus</i>, <i>Rhynchonella Lewisii</i>; but the section is a poor
one, and is covered up almost immediately by the overlying
Carboniferous.</p>

<p>(2.) <span class="smcap">Walsall and Barr.</span>&mdash;This is the typical area
for the well known Barr Trilobite <i>Illenus Barriensis</i>. The
quarries of the Woolhope Limestone which afford it are
now disused, but a good section of the fossiliferous shales
above is displayed in the railway cutting between Aldridge
and Walsall. The overlying Wenlock or Dudley Limestones
are mined at the town of Walsall itself, but good
fossils are now comparatively rare.</p>

<p>(3.) <span class="smcap">Dudley and the Wren’s Nest.</span>&mdash;By far the
most notable and interesting of the Silurian exposures are
those of the neighbourhood of Dudley. In the three
exposures of Dudley Castle, the Wren’s Nest, and S<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>edgley
Hill, the Silurian limestone rises up in steep dome-like
forms. This limestone, which is that of the Wenlock of
Siluria, is here composed of two calcareous bands&mdash;the
higher about 28 feet in thickness, and the lower about 42
feet&mdash;separated from each other by an intermediate zone
of about 90 feet of gray shales. The limestone has been
worked for centuries as a flux for the ironstones of the
coalfield. The hills have been mined to a great depth,
and all the best limestone rock extracted. The intervening
and enveloping shales have been allowed to remain,
and the present structure of the hills is that of a central
dome surrounded by two enveloping shells, separated
from each other by two more or less empty spaces. Where
the dip of the rock is high, and these excavated parts are
exposed, they form deep moat-like hollows, bounded by
walls of shale. Where the dip is low, and the overhanging
rocks are supported by the vast pillars left by the workmen,
these excavations form magnificent caverns of
peculiar weirdness and beauty. In the heart of the hill
at greater depths they form damp gloomy chasms of
enormous extent, which can only be seen to perfection
when lit up by artificial light.</p>

<p>The Dudley limestone bands and the surrounding
calcareous shales have long been famous for the abundance
and beauty of their included fossils. Many of the
type species of Murchison’s Silurian System came from
this locality; but since the superficial limestones have
been worked out, good specimens are exceedingly rare.
An excellent collection of the fossils of these beds is laid
out in the Dudley Museum, and another in the Geological
Museum of the Mason College. Many good collections
are in the possession of private individuals in Dudley
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The best localities for fossils at present are the shaly
slopes on the flanks of the Wren’s Nest, where the usual
Wenlock Brachiopods and Corals are abundant, but the
beautiful Trilobites of the formation are but rarely met
with.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<p>The Wenlock limestone occurs both in the Dudley
Castle Hill and in the Wren’s Nest. The Aymestry
limestone is only met with in a single locality on the flanks
of Sedgley Hill, where it yields occasional specimens of
its characteristic fossil, the <i>Pentamerus Knightii</i>.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Carboniferous Rocks.</span></h5>

<p>Rocks of Carboniferous age make their appearance at
four distinct localities within the limits of the Birmingham
District, viz., in the coal fields of Coalbrookdale, the
Forest of Wyre, South Staffordshire, and East Warwickshire.
The strata exposed on the last three of these coalfields
are those of the upper Carboniferous or Coal
measures; neither the Carboniferous limestone nor the
Millstone grit being met with outside the limits of the
coalfield of Coalbrookdale.</p>

<p>In the Forest of Wyre the Coal measures rest upon the
Old Red Sandstone, in the South Staffordshire Coalfield
upon the various members of the Silurian, and in the East
Warwickshire upon the Upper Cambrian rocks. In these
three coalfields a two-fold division of the Carboniferous is
recognisable:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <i>The Lower Coal Measures</i> proper, consisting of
grey sandstones and shales with occasional coal seams,
some of which are of remarkable thickness.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <i>Upper Coal Measures</i>, or Halesowen grey and red
sandstones, brick clays and marls, with occasional coal-seams,
none, however, of commercial value.</p>

<p>In the South Staffordshire and East Warwickshire
coalfields, the well known “<i>Spirorbis Limestone</i>” of the
Upper Coal Measures occurs in its normal place near
the summit of the Carboniferous series.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">South Staffordshire Coalfield.</span>&mdash;The Carboniferous
rocks of South Staffordshire are arranged in a
broad dome about 23 miles in length by 6 in breadth.
Their basement beds rest unconformably upon the Silurian
around the flanks of the Dudley Hills, and in the neighbourhood
of Walsall. Their highest beds dip conformably
below the Permian rocks at the southern extrem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>ity of the
coalfield south of Halesowen, and are overlapped unconformably
by the Triassic pebble beds at its northern
extremity, in the district of Cannock Chase. The eastern
and western boundaries of the coalfield are formed by
lines of fault, which have flung down against the Coal
Measures the various members of the Permian and the
Triassic. The total thickness of the Carboniferous beds
is about 1,300 feet, and the normal succession in the
central and highest part of the coalfield is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Upper Coal Measures.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>2a.</i> Halesowen Sandstone Group, 600 to 800 feet.</p>

<p><i>2b.</i> Red Coal Measure Clays.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lower Coal Measures</i>, 500 to 600 feet, containing
several excellent coal seams, of which the following are
the most important:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Brooch Coal, 4 feet.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Thick Coal, 30 feet.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) Heathen Coal, 3 feet.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) New Mine Coal, 2 to 11 feet.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) Fire Clay Coal, 1 to 14 feet.</p>

<p>(<i>f.</i>) Bottom Coal, five feet and above.</p>

</div>

<p>These measures include several zones of workable ironstone,
of which the most important are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1.) The Pins and Pennyearth ironstones, below the
Brooch coal.</p>

<p>(2.) The Whittery and Gubbin ironstones, below the
Thick coal.</p>

<p>(3.) The Blue Flats, Silver Threads and Diamond
Ironstones, below the Bottom coal.</p>

</div>

<p>For its size the South Staffordshire coalfield has proved
itself the richest mineral area in Britain. Thick coal
seams, rich bands of ironstone, and great thicknesses of
Silurian limestone, all occur within a short distance of
each other, and all within easy reach of the miner. The
natural result has been that the South Staffordshire coalfield
and its immediate neighbourhood has been the great
coal and iron mart of Central Britain, and the abundance
and cheapness of its material it has afforded, have rendered
Birmingham and the “Black Country” the hardware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
workshop of the world.</p>

<p>Almost all the available coal seams and ironstone beds
within easy reach have been long since practically worked
out, but there is still much excellent coal and iron to be
obtained at greater depths, especially in the northern part
of the coalfield. Of late years the Triassic rocks which
surround the coalfield have been pierced in order to reach
the Coal measures beneath. An entirely new coalfield
has been developed in this manner in the district of
Cannock Chase; and two most remarkable collieries,
those of Sandwell Park, and Hamstead, have been
opened in the neighbourhood of Birmingham itself.</p>

<p>The area immediately underlain by the Coal measures
constitutes the district of the “Black Country,” which
extends from the western margin of Birmingham to the
fringe of Cannock Chase. It includes within its limits,
the large towns of Dudley, Walsall, Wolverhampton,
Bilston, and others of scarcely less note.</p>

<p>The most remarkable seam of the South Staffordshire
coalfield is that known as the Ten yard or Thick coal, a
continuous bed of workable coal from 25 to 30 feet in
thickness. This underlies all the south central part of the
field in the area enclosed by Smethwick, Oldbury, Dudley,
Walsall and Bilston. To the southward near Halesowen it
thins out and becomes mixed with shaly material. It is
in reality composed of 13 or 14 superimposed coal seams,
which form an apparently unbroken mass, but are easily distinguished
individually by the practised Thick coal miner.
As we pass northward from the typical Thick coal area
towards Walsall and Cannock Chase, the component seams
become separated by intercalated sandstones and shales,
so that eventually in the district of Essington and Pelsall
the Thick coal is represented by 14 distinct coals occurring
at intervals in a mass of sandy rock, between 500 and 600
feet in total thickness. The Thick coal is known to extend
far to the eastward, beyond the present margin of the
South Staffordshire coalfield. The first attempt to reach it
through the red ground (Permian) was made under the bold
and skilful guidance of the late Mr. Henry Johnson, C.E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>,
of Dudley, at the locality of Sandwell Park. The coal was
reached in 1873 at a depth of 1,250 feet and found to be
of its original thickness, and of excellent quality. The
next attempt which was made at Hamstead Hall, about
three miles outside the limit of the coalfield, was even
bolder and more hazardous, but it was eventually crowned
with equal success; the Thick coal being reached at a
depth of 1,800 feet. As the demand for coal increases,
other collieries will doubtless be started at fresh localities
outside the limits of the coalfield, for there can be no
question that the Thick coal extends far to the eastward,
under and beyond the town of Birmingham itself.</p>

<p>The strata of the South Staffordshire Coalfield afford
the usual fossils of the British Coal Measures. The roofs
of the coal seams, and the layers of carbonaceous shale,
locally furnish well preserved examples of <i>Lepidodendron</i>,
<i>Sigillaria</i>, <i>Calamites</i>, <i>Annularia</i>, <i>Pecopteris</i>, <i>Neuropteris</i>,
etc., often associated with abundant specimens of the
peculiar <i>Unio</i>-like shell, <i>Anthracosia</i>: while the ironstone
nodules occasionally yield fragmentary <i>Crustaceans</i>
and <i>Insects</i>. Marine fossils are principally confined to the
lower beds of the series, below the Thick coal. Owing to
the absence of true limestone beds in the coalfield, the
characteristic corals, &amp;c., of the Carboniferous are absent,
but the following marine forms are not uncommon in the
lower ironstones:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lingula elliptica</i>, <i>Discina nitida</i>, <i>Producta scrabicula</i>,
<i>Conularia quadrisulcata</i>, <i>Aviculopecten scalaris</i>, <i>Gyracanthus
farmosus</i>, <i>Megalichthys Hibberti</i>, <i>Pœcilodus angustus</i>.</p>

<p>These have been met with at several localities near
Walsall, Oldbury, Old Hill, Kingswinford, and Oldswinford,
etc.</p>

<p>The rocks of the South Staffordshire coalfield are
pierced locally by sheets of igneous rock. The most important
of these is a mass of dolerite about two miles and
a half in length, which caps the long ridge of Rowley
Regis. It is traversed by several mining shafts, which pass
through the dolerite into the workable coals below. Other
igneous masses occur near Dudley, and at Pouk Hill, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Walsall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The East Warwickshire Coalfield.</span>&mdash;The rocks of
this coalfield form a narrow strip about 15 miles in length,
ranging from Tamworth on the north to Bedworth on
the South. The coalbearing strata rest unconformably
upon the Cambrian below, and pass up conformably into
the Permian above. The sequence of the beds is practically
identical with that of South Staffordshire&mdash;the richer
coal measures being all confined to the lower part of the
Carboniferous series, and passing up through a group of
coloured clays into a final group of barren sandstones. In
the north of the coalfield five workable seams of coal
occur, separated by many feet of barren measures. As
they pass to the southward the intermediate strata thin
out, and the coal-beds practically come together at Hawkesbury
to form one Main coal seam, as do the corresponding
members of the Thick coal of South Staffordshire. It is
probable that the two coalfields were formed in the same
general area of deposition, and except for the possibility
of its destruction by erosion prior to the deposition of the
Triassic, it might be suggested with safety that the Thick
coal of South Staffordshire extends in a continuous sheet
under the red rocks of Northern Warwickshire from Smethwick
to Hawkesbury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forest of Wyre.</span>&mdash;Unlike the strata of the other
coalfields, the Carboniferous rocks of the coalfield of the
Forest of Wyre are comparatively barren of good coal
seams. The best, which is locally known as the <i>Main</i>
coal, is about seven-and a-half feet in thickness, and occurs
at an average depth of 300 feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coalbrookdale.</span>&mdash;This coalfield, which lies to the
east of the Wrekin, covers an area of about 28 square
miles. It originally contained about 28 coal seams, but the
majority of these are now practically worked out. The
succession includes the Carboniferous limestone, the
Millstone grit, and the Lower coal-measures in conformable
sequence. The Upper coal-measures rest in a hollow
eroded out of the Lower coal-measures beneath, forming
what is locally known as the “Symon Fault.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Permian or Dyassic.</span></h5>

<p>The Permian rocks of the Birmingham District are
totally distinct in their petrological characters from those
of the typical area of Yorkshire and Durham. No true
limestones are present, and the formation is wholly made
up of red sandstones, marls and beds of angular breccia.</p>

<p>The lowest zones of the Permian repose conformably
upon the Upper Coal Measures of the South Staffordshire
Coalfield in the slopes of the hills to the south of Halesowen,
and its strata are seen in corresponding relation to
the Carboniferous on the east of the Coalfields of the
Forest of Wyre and Coalbrookdale, and to the west of
the Coalfield of Eastern Warwickshire.</p>

<p>The Permian is everywhere covered up unconformably,
or locally overlapped, by the various members of the
Triassic formation; all the subdivisions of the Triassic
series being found resting immediately upon it in turns
as they are followed from the valley of the Severn to the
neighbourhood of Charnwood Forest.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Enville and the Forest of
Wyre, three divisions are recognisable in the Permian,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1.) <i>Lower Red Sandstones and Marls</i>, with bands of
calcareous conglomerate.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Coarse Breccia.</i></p>

<p>(3.) <i>Upper Red Sandstones and Marls.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Round the South Staffordshire Coalfield the Breccia is
the highest division exposed, and this only occurs in force
to the south of the coalfield.</p>

<p>Between Tamworth and Kenilworth, to the east of
Birmingham, the Permian strata floor a wide tract of
country, and lie almost horizontal. Red sandstones, marls
and beds of breccia occur in association, but the divisions
named above are not individually recognisable.</p>

<p>By far the most striking local member of the Permian
formation is the so-called <i>Volcanic or Permian Breccia</i>. It
is found in scattered patches over an area of about 500
square miles, extending from the Malverns to Enville,
Stourbridge, and the Lickey Hills. It is made up of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
angular fragments of volcanic rocks, tuffs, altered shales,
grits, and slabs of fossiliferous sandstone and limestones,
all embedded in paste of bright red marl or pebbly sandstone.
It is usually both underlain and overlain by red
sandstones and marls, but sometimes, as at Stagbury and
Woodbury Hills, &amp;c., in the Valley of the Severn, it
reposes at once upon pre-Permian rock.</p>

<p>This peculiar Breccia is well displayed in the Clent
Hills, between Hagley and Halesowen. It there reposes
upon the Lower Permian Sandstones with calcareous grit
bands&mdash;(which may be seen above the little Church of
St. Kenelm)&mdash;and forms all the highest points of the
Clent Hills, passing unconformably to the southward
under the pebble beds of the New Red Sandstone. In
this locality the angular fragments composing the Breccia
are mainly volcanic:&mdash;rhyolites, porphyrites, ashes, and
volcanic grits, embedded in a coarse matrix formed of
similar materials. Other sections are seen in the Bromsgrove
Lickey Hills, and in the neighbourhood of
Northfield. In the last-named locality an excellent
section is exposed in a lane leading from the Bell Inn to
Bangham Pit. In this exposure the breccia, which shows
the usual preponderance of volcanic materials, contains in
addition fragments of Silurian limestone (crowded with
characteristic fossils), and pieces of Landovery grit and
shale.</p>

<p>According to Sir Andrew Ramsay,<a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> this Permian breccia
is probably of glacial origin, its materials having been
brought down by ice in Permian times from the neighbourhood
of the Longmynd in central Shropshire, where
all the formations represented in its derived rock
fragments occur at present in natural juxtaposition.
According to Professor Jukes,<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the fragments of the
Northfield breccia, at any rate, “may have been derived
from adjacent rocks, now conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>ed under the Permian
and New Red Sandstone.”</p>

<h4>The Triassic Rocks.</h4>

<p class="author">BY W. JEROME HARRISON, F.G.S.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the Midland Counties of
England is composed of red sandstones and marls. The
town of Birmingham stands upon, and is surrounded by
rocks of this character. They form the Triassic System
of geologists, the first of the four grand members of the
Mesozoic series.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the title <i>Trias</i> is a misnomer as
applied to the English development of the rocks of this
system. The central member of the typical German succession,
the <i>Muschelkalk</i>, is wanting in Britain; and only
the upper and lower divisions, the so-called Keuper and
Bunter, are represented. The <i>Bunter</i> or lower Trias, consists
in the Midland areas of a mass of pebble beds or
conglomerate, usually underlain and overlain by variegated
sandstones. The <i>Keuper</i> is formed of a great thickness
of red marly strata, with a thick sandstone (<i>Waterstones</i>)
at the base.</p>

<p>The following table shews the subdivisions of the Trias
which have been recognised in England, together with (<i>a</i>)
their maximum thickness, and (<i>b</i>) their thickness in the
neighbourhood of Birmingham.</p>

<p>The Trias enters England on the south coast, between
Torbay and Exmouth. At the little watering-place of
Budleigh Salterton there is a bed of quartzite pebbles
in the Trias 100 feet thick which is worthy of study i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>n
connection with the great numbers of similar pebbles
that occur in the same strata round Birmingham. In
West Somerset and Devon, the Triassic strata are 3,500
feet in thickness. Their subdivisions cannot be correlated
with those of the Midlands, for they appear to have been
deposited in a separate basin, of which the Mendips, &amp;c.,
still mark the northern boundary.</p>

<p>Crossing into Gloucestershire, we find the vale of the
Severn composed of Triassic marls, and thence northwards
the “red rocks” broaden till they form the plains of
Cheshire and South Lancashire on the west, and extend
eastward to Warwick, Leicester, and Derby. From this
great central plain of our island a long strip of Triassic
sandstones and marls runs northwards, forming the Vale
of Trent and the Vale of York, until finally it reaches the
coast between Redcar and Hartlepool. Along the main
line of outcrop&mdash;from the Malvern Hills to the mouth of
the Tees&mdash;the Triassic strata incline gently, or dip, to the
south-east, at from two to five degrees.</p>

<p>Of the two great divisions of the Trias, the lower
(Bunter) is mainly sandy; while the upper (Keuper) is
chiefly a stiff marl or clay. One result of this is that
while the outcrop of the former is usually barren, forming
much heath or waste land, as Sherwood Forest, the
Keuper marls produce a rich soil, well fitted for the
plough.</p>

<p>Owing to the soft nature of the strata, valleys are
usually hollowed out in the Lower and Upper Mottled Sandstones,
while the Keuper marls form an undulating plain.
On the other hand the harder nature of the Bunter
pebble bed, and the Lower Keuper Sandstone, causes
these two rocks to form escarpments or lines of hills,
parallel to each other; the abrupt face generally looking
west or north-west, while the gentle slope is to the east or
south-east, agreeing with the average dip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lower Red and Mottled Sandstone.</span>&mdash;Round
Bridgenorth this division rests unconformably on
Permian strata, and is about 650 feet thick. It is a
homogeneous sandstone, of reddish-brown, yellow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
bright red colours, entirely devoid of pebbles. As we
follow this stratum to the east it decreases in thickness,
being only 200 feet near Stourbridge. East of the South
Staffordshire field, the Lower Mottled Sandstone is
entirely absent, and the Bunter pebble beds repose
directly upon the Permian rocks. Geologists desirous of
examining the “Lower Mottled” should visit Kinver Edge,
west of Stourbridge, where this rock is well seen underlying
the Bunter conglomerate. Its upper portion has
here been hardened by calcareous matter, and projects
beyond the pebble beds above. Caves, or “rock-houses,”
have been excavated in the Edge, and in a detached
mass of sandstone called the Holy Austen Rock. The
Lower Mottled Sandstone is again visible on Whittington
Common, between Kinver and Stourbridge. It is everywhere
quite unfossiliferous. “False bedding” is especially
characteristic of this division, but it is common in all the
Midland Triassic sandstones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bunter Conglomerate or Pebble-bed</span>
occupies the surface of the Birmingham area, along a line
running from south-west to north-east. It extends from
Worcester, by Bridgnorth, Stourbridge, Cannock Chase,
and Sutton Park to Lichfield. At all these places it is
seen as a remarkable mass of rounded pebbles&mdash;mostly
yellow, brown, or liver-coloured quartzites&mdash;and attains
a thickness of 300 feet at Cannock Chase. West of
Stourbridge the Conglomerate forms the “Ridge,” and
caps Kinver Edge, dipping east or south-east at from five
to eight degrees. Thence it is traceable northward by
Upper Penn and Bushbury to Cannock Chase, where it
forms a wide undulating heathy moorland, six miles in
breadth from Bednall on the west to Rugeley on the east,
and is exposed in many gravel pits and other excavations.
The Staffordshire Coalfield lies like a great wedge between
the Trias on its western and eastern sides. Crossing
over from Stourbridge, we again find the Bunter Conglomerate
or Pebble-beds extending between Harborne
and Smethwick, and thence it runs northward in a broad
band across the western suburbs of Birmingham, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Winson Green, Handsworth, Perry Barr, and Perry, to
Sutton Park (where its outcrop is 3½ miles wide), and on
to Aldridge, Wreford, Hopwas Wood, and Lichfield
Racecourse. All along this line the Pebble-beds rest on
Permian marls, and their thickness at Barr Beacon is
about 400 feet. Good sections of the pebble-beds are
rare on the south-west or west of Birmingham, but in the
north-west they are well seen in a quarry south of Great
Barr Station, and in one or two sections near the Beacon.
At Sutton, exposures along the new railway lines to
Lichfield and to Walsall have been numerous and good,
and the Quarry in the Park, close to Blackroot Pool, gives
a vertical section of thirty feet. Each section shows a
mass of well-rounded hard pebbles, which have been
so pressed together during the earth-movements that have
taken place since their deposition that many are cracked,
while all bear white indentations. The Bunter Conglomerate
contains no fossils of contemporaneous age, but
many species of shells have been obtained from the hard,
rounded lumps of rock of which it is composed. These
fossils being of necessity of the age of the rock-fragments
in which they are included, they furnish a clue to the
sources from which the pebble-beds were derived. The
following list of these derivative fossils will give some idea
of the results which have already been obtained:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Ordovician</span> (in quartzite pebbles).&mdash;(<i>Arenig
Beds.</i>) <i>Lingula Lesueurii.</i> (This interesting brachiopod
shell has not yet been found in its parent rock
in England, though it is not uncommon in the <i>Gres
Armoricain</i> of Brittany, a quartzite on the same
horizon as the Stiper stones); various lamellibranchs
such as <i>Modiolopsis</i>, <i>Palaearca</i>, and <i>Lyrodesma</i> occur.</p>

<p>(<i>Caradoc and Bala Beds.</i>)&mdash;Seven or eight species
of brachiopods, of which the commonest is <i>Orthis
Budleighensis</i>; a crinoid (<i>Glyptocrinus basalis</i>), &amp;c.</p>

<p>(<i>May Hill Sandstone.</i>)&mdash;Lumps of coarse sandstone,
identical lithologically with the rock which
flanks the Lickey Hills, occur commonly; they
contain numerous casts of <i>Stricklandinia lirata</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Devonian.</span>&mdash;Nine or ten species of brachiopods
(especially <i>Spirifera Verneuilii</i>). Remains of trilobites,
such as <i>Phacops</i> and <i>Homalonotus</i> are not
unfrequent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mountain Limestone.</span>&mdash;Mr. Molyneux enumerates
twenty-two species of mountain limestone fossils&mdash;brachiopods,
corals, crinoids, &amp;c.&mdash;which he
obtained from the Bunter pebble-beds of Trentham.
Near Birmingham, fragments of partly decomposed
chert, in which the stems of crinoids are beautifully
shown, are common in the same strata.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Upper Red and Mottled Sandstone.</span>&mdash;Stourbridge
stands on the bright red sands of this division,
which extend northward through Kingswinford to Trysall
and Tettenhall. South of Birmingham we find the same
strata at Harborne Heath and Mill&mdash;there is a good
exposure underneath the drift in Flavel’s brick pit
at “California”&mdash;from which point we can trace the
“Upper Mottled” across the western part of Birmingham,
by Rotton Park Reservoir and the Botanical Gardens; the
beautiful soft red sandstone forming a strip about a mile
in width between Spring Hill, Hockley Brook, Aston Villa,
and Birchfields on the west, to the foot of Snow Hill, and
Aston Park on the east. In the cemetery adjoining the
Great Western Station at Hockley, there is a grand section,
forty feet in height, where the incoherent sand is
largely worked for moulding and foundry purposes. It is
also exposed in and round Aston Park.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Lower Keuper Sandstone.</span>&mdash;The lower
member of the Keuper is the most consolidated part of
the Triassic formation, being best known as a tolerably
hard sandstone, white or pink in colour, which often
yields good building stone.</p>

<p>The “basement beds” of the Keuper are certain coarse
sandstones and chocolate coloured marls seen in a pit at
“California,” near Harborne. Above these come massively-bedded
sandstones, of which there is a good exposure in
the now disused quarry at Weoley Castle.</p>

<p>Commencing at Edgbaston, we can trace the Lower
Keuper Sandstone by the Five Ways, and across t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>he
central highest part of Birmingham to Nechells, Gravelly
Hill, and Erdington. Its lower boundary line, where it
reposes on the Bunter, may be indicated by a line drawn
from the junction of Monument Road with Hagley Road
to the bottom of Snow Hill, and thence to Aston Station.
From this point it extends eastward, for from one mile
(Edgbaston) to half-a-mile (Aston). The ridge on which
stands the Town Hall, St. Philip’s Church, &amp;c., (475 feet
above sea-level) is formed by the Lower Keuper Sandstone,
and deep excavations for foundations in the centre of the
town, frequently disclose the thin-bedded, dull-coloured,
pinkish sandstones (known to workmen as “skerry”)
which constitute the upper portion of this rock. Its thickness
under Birmingham may be estimated at 200 feet.
The average dip is from three to five degrees south-east.
Similar beds are exposed in the cutting at Bromsgrove
Railway Station, and it was from a quarry here (now
closed) that the remarkable fossil fish was obtained, which
was described by Sir Philip Egerton as <i>Dipteronotus
cyphus</i>. From quarries at Coton End, Guy’s Cliff, Cubbington
and Blakedown Hill, near Warwick, bones and
teeth of four species of the <i>Labyrinthodon</i> have been obtained,
and foot-prints of the same creature have been
found in the Lower Keuper Sandstone in many localities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Keuper Red Marl</span> is the uppermost member of
the Trias. Near Birmingham it is abruptly separated
from the Lower Keuper Sandstone by a line of <i>fault</i>,
which can be traced from Selly Oak northwards to the
junction of the Rea with the Tame. East of this line of
fault, the red marls extend for ten or twelve miles forming
an undulating fertile plain, on which stand Moseley,
Smallheath, and Castle Bromwich, Coleshill and Whitacre.
The thickness of the Keuper Marls is considerable.
A boring in Smallheath Park was made to a depth of 440
feet entirely in such strata; but quite lately another
boring at King’s Heath has been continued to a depth of
700 feet. Gypsum is plentiful in the red marls, occurring
in white fibrous layers, but not of sufficient thickness to be
of any value in this district. At Droitwich (eighteen miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
south-west of Birmingham) the Keuper Marls contain a
thick bed of rock salt, which yields an inexhaustible
supply of <i>brine</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Upper Keuper Sandstone</i> is a thin band of
sandstone, not exceeding thirty feet in thickness, which
occurs irregularly in the upper part of the Keuper Marls.
It is well exposed at the entrance to the canal tunnel at
Shrewley Common, and in a small quarry at Rowington
(thirteen miles south-east of Birmingham), and also crops
out on the hill sides at many points in South Warwickshire.
From this thin stratum, the Rev. P. B. Brodie,
F.G.S., has obtained a fossil fish (<i>Palæoniscus superstes</i>),
and the crustacean (<i>Estheria minuta</i>). Specimens of these
may be seen in the Warwick Museum, which contains the
finest collection of Triassic fossils possessed by any provincial
museum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How the Triassic Rocks were formed.</span>&mdash;According
to the writer’s views, the area now occupied by central
England, alternated in condition during the Carboniferous
epoch, between a low plain and a shallow sea. In the
Permian period, land conditions prevailed, except in the
North and North Midland Counties, where a brackish sea
somewhat like the Baltic, it may be&mdash;occupied a shallow
depression. In Triassic times this central sea appears to
have been completely cut off from the open ocean, and
to have formed a large inland lake, comparable to the
Caspian or the Dead Sea of our own day. The southern
boundary of this inland sea was formed by a ridge of
old rocks which extended from Charnwood by Hartshill
and the Lickey to the Wrekin and Malvern Hills. In the
basin north of this axial ridge, all the subdivisions of the
Bunter and the Keuper were in turn deposited; and the
cliffs and reefs of the Palæozoic rocks of which this coastline
was composed, yielded large contributions to the
pebble-beds, sands and marls, which constitute the Trias.
According to a theory originally advanced by Professor
Hull, and ably supported by Professor Bonney, the
pebbles of the Bunter were mainly derived from the
Paleozoic Rocks of the N.W. and N.E., some being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
possibly furnished by the ancient strata of N.W. Scotland.</p>

<p>The waters of the Triassic sea were so overcharged
with salts of iron, that every grain of sand was encrusted,
before its deposition, with a pellicle of peroxide of iron:
of chloride of sodium (common salt) and sulphate of
sodium (gypsum), there was also an excess, so that much
was deposited on the sea-floor, producing beds of rock-salt
and of gypsum, of considerable thickness. The
presence of these mineral substances in the water was
prejudicial to life, so that&mdash;as in the Dead Sea, and in
Lake Utah to-day&mdash;few living creatures could inhabit the
Triassic sea, and fossils are consequently of extreme
rarity in strata of this age.</p>

<p><i>The Trias as a source of Water Supply.</i>&mdash;The Triassic
strata are so porous, that they absorb a large proportion
of the rain which falls upon them, and they consequently
form an underground reservoir which, when tapped by
wells or boreholes, is capable of yielding an almost inexhaustible
supply of good, though somewhat hard water. In
this way Birmingham receives three-fourths of its water
from three deep wells&mdash;two on the north-east of the town,
at Aston and at Perry respectively, and one on the south-west,
near Selly Oak. These wells extend to depths of
400 feet, passing through the Upper Mottled Sandstone,
and piercing the pebble beds, and the average supply of
water from each is three million gallons per day. The hardness
varies from nine to fifteen degrees. There are many
other deep wells in and round the West of Birmingham,
and at Stourbridge, Wolverhampton, etc., which derive
their water from the same source.</p>

<h4>Liassic and Rhætic.</h4>

<p class="author">BY REV. P. B. BRODIE, M.A., F.G.S.</p>

<p>The Lias occupies a large area in the south and east
of the Birmingham District, and consists for the most
part of the middle and lower divisions. The highest
position of the Lias is seen on the south and south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>-eastern
division of Warwickshire, the middle Lias forms
the hills projecting in spurs to the north-west, and the
lower division extending in the same direction, at a lower
level, up to the southern edge of the Trias.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upper Lias.</span>&mdash;The Upper Lias is chiefly represented
by a thin bed of clay, with some characteristic fossils. It
occurs on the hills of Fenny Compton and elsewhere, and
there is evidence to show that it formerly capped the range
of the Edge Hills adjacent, occupying its natural position
above the marlstone, or Middle Lias, of which they are
mainly composed. From Fenny Compton to Harbury, a
good descending section may be obtained from the
marlstone (rock bed), through the underlying clays and
marly beds, through the “Lima Beds” and White Lias,
to the New Red Marls at Harbury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marlstone or Middle Lias.</span>&mdash;The Marlstone (rock
bed) is largely quarried on the Avon and Burton Dassett
Hills. It forms a good building stone, more or less indurated,
of a green or yellow brown colour, sometimes ferruginous.
It forms a conspicuous range of hills of moderate
height of which Edge Hill is the highest, from which it
strikes southward towards Oxfordshire. The plain below is
occupied by the underlying division of the Lower Lias.
In this county the marlstone contains very few fossils,
and those chiefly brachiopodous shells belonging to the
genus <i>Terebratula</i>. In most cases elsewhere the Marlstone
proper, or highest zone, is very fossiliferous, and abounds
in marine shells, which are usually well preserved. The
sandy beds immediately below are rarely exposed, but
crop out in a lane near Bitham House, where as usual
they contain many fossils. The inferior clays and marls
are not visible except in some brick pits near Fenny
Compton and along the line of railway. These are very
full of fossils in the zone of <i>Ammonites Jamiesoni</i> and
<i>Ibex</i>, here nearly one hundred feet thick, and especially
at one horizon in a coarse, hard, stony band which
contains numerous corals towards the upper part of the
cutting, near the station.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lower Lias.</span>&mdash;For the most part this formation spreads
over the portion of the country on the north-east, east,
south-east, south and south-west of Warwick. A remarkably
fine section is exposed in the railway cutting near
Harbury Station. This portion of the series is also
largely quarried at Rugby, and in other places south and
south-east of Stratford. The strata consist of beds of
blue clay or shale interstratified with beds of blue rubbly
and argillaceous limestone, much quarried for hydraulic
lime. One good section of the lime-yielding beds occurs
at Messrs. Greaves and Lakin’s Quarries at Stockton and
Harbury. The lowest zones of the Lias are largely
quarried at Wilmcote, and may be seen at the remarkable
outlier of Brown’s Wood, near Henley-in-Arden, and at
another (Copt Heath), near Knowle. These two last are of
special interest, because they shew the lowest beds of the
Lias (in connection with and passing into the Rhætics,)
resting immediately upon the New Red Marls. The
thickness of the Lower Lias in the county is above 600
feet; but only the inferior zones of <i>Ammonites angulatus</i>
and <i>A. planorbis</i> are laid open to any great extent. The
best sections of the <i>Lima</i> beds (<i>A. angulatus</i> zone) occur
in the railway cutting at Harbury, Stockton lime quarries,
and the extensive quarries at Newbold near Rugby. Fossils
are not very numerous, but the following occur:&mdash;<i>Gryphea
incurva</i>, <i>Rhynchonella variabilis</i>, <i>Ammonites angulatus</i>,
<i>Pecten</i>, various species, <i>Lima gigantea</i>, and bones and
teeth of <i>Plesiosaurus</i> and <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>. Fish are comparatively
rare, two or three only were found at Harbury
and a very few near Rugby.</p>

<p>The higher ground round Wilmcote and Binton is also
capped by these Lima beds; but the district is more or
less affected by small faults, so that certain beds in one
contiguous quarry are absent in another. The lower
limestones (insect beds) are largely worked in this locality,
and are of much economical value. With the exception
of remains of insects and fragments of plants, the fossils
are entirely marine, <i>Ammonites planorbis</i> and <i>A. Johnstoni</i>,
being abundant and characteristic. Crustacea belonging
to the genera <i>Astacus</i> and <i>Eryon</i>, the lat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>ter of great size
are not unfrequently met with. Small fishes, <i>Pholidophorus
Stricklandi</i>, and the larger <i>Dapedium</i> and <i>Tetragonolepis</i>
more rarely occur. A fine example of the latter is
preserved in the Warwick Museum. The large <i>Enaliosaurians</i>
are well represented by some fine specimens of
<i>Ichthyosaurus</i> and <i>Plesiosaurus</i>; the <i>P. megacephalus</i> in
the Museum at Warwick being nearly entire, measuring
14 feet 4 inches in length. Large masses of driftwood
and a few fronds of ferns are sometimes met with. But
perhaps the most interesting and remarkable fossils are
the insects. Twenty-four families and genera were
determined more than twenty years ago, since which time
many important additions have been made. The <i>Coleoptera</i>
and <i>Neuroptera</i> are most numerous. Small beetles
are not unfrequently found entire. Among these may
be noted the families <i>Buprestidæ</i>, <i>Elateridæ</i>, <i>Carabidæ</i>,
and others.</p>

<p>There are also remains of <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Homoptera</i>,
<i>Libellulidæ</i>, and some <i>Diptera</i>. Many of the <i>Neuroptera</i>
were evidently of gigantic proportions, but most of the
insects were of small size, and like the associated plants,
are indicative of a temperate climate. They are most nearly
allied to forms which now inhabit North America. There
are few extinct or unknown genera among them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhætic Series.</span>&mdash;The highest beds referred to this
series consist of certain hard, fine grained limestones,
which, from their ordinary white colour, have been termed
<i>White Lias</i>. They occupy a considerable area south and
south-east of Warwick. They constitute a purely local
deposit, and are confined for the most part to this county
and Somersetshire. They are often close-grained and
hard limestones, and make a useful building material and
a good lime. Their colour is mostly white, with a yellow
tinge, and occasionally pink and grey. Some geologists
consider these beds to belong to the “Rhætic Series,” others
to the passage beds between the Lias and the latter, while
others still class them with the Lias.</p>

<p>The undisputed Rhætic rocks lie between the White
Lias and the Triassic Marls. In Warwickshire they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> are rarely
exposed, and then much reduced in bulk, compared with
their development in Gloucester and Glamorgan. They
may be seen to a limited extent below the White Lias in
the railway cutting at Harbury, where a band of yellowish
sandstone contains the small bivalved crustacean, <i>Estheria
minuta</i>; and also at the small outlier of Brown’s Wood,
and at Stooper’s Wood, near Wooton Wawen, where this
sandstone occurs with inferior shelly limestones and
sandy bands, containing the usual Rhætic fossils, <i>e.g.</i>,
<i>Cardium Rhæticum</i>, <i>Avicula contorta</i>, <i>Pleurophorus
elongatus</i>, <i>Pecten valoniensis</i>, and <i>Schizodus cloacinus</i>.
The nearest exposure of the Rhætic to Birmingham
occurs round the fringe of an outlier of Lower Lias
resting on the Upper Red Marl near the village of Knowle.
This outlier is about a mile and a half long, by half a mile
broad. Its highest beds at Copt Heath contain <i>Ammonites
planorbis</i>. The beds referred to the Rhætic include a
stratum of yellow micaceous sandstone full of <i>Schizodus
cloacinus</i>, which, though usually in the form of casts, is
sharp and well defined. The bone bed, though no where
exposed, is probably present in its normal position. A
fine section, with numerous characteristic Rhætic fossils was
exposed on the railway cutting at Summer Hill,
between Stratford and Alcester. Rhætic black shales
were passed through at Snitterfield, in making a tunnel in
connection with the new reservoir for Stratford.</p>

<h4>Glacial and Post Tertiary Deposits.</h4>

<p class="author">BY H. W. CROSSKEY, LL.D., F.G.S.</p>

<p>Post Tertiary Deposits are scattered profusely over the
district of which Birmingham is the centre, and present
many problems of too complicated a character to be discussed
in the pages of this guide. It must suffice to indicate
a few of their chief exposures and characteristics. The
term “<i>Boulder Clay</i>” is used in this note to denote a
clay shown to be connected with the Glacial epoch, by
containing a greater or less number of erratic blocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>; and
in the employment of the term, no theory regarding the
method of formation of the deposit will be implied.</p>

<p>The Post Tertiary deposits of the district may be
arranged in the following general order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I.&mdash;Lower boulder clays.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;Middle glacial clays, sands, and gravels.</p>

<p>III.&mdash;Upper boulder clays.</p>

<p>IV.&mdash;Post glacial clay, sands, and gravels.</p>

</div>

<p>The most complete section that has been found is at
“California,” near Harborne.</p>

<p>Resting upon the Bunter Sandstone, about 480 feet
above the sea level, is a <i>Lower boulder clay</i>, containing
erratic boulders of slate, felsite, quartzite, intermixed with
blocks and stones of local origin. Many of the erratics
are angular, and some (especially the slates) are finely
striated. The whole deposit is unstratified and compact,
and the boulders are roughly pressed together, in every
variety of position, without any orderly arrangement.
This boulder clay is succeeded by the <i>Middle Sands and
Gravels</i> which are irregularly stratified and show false bedding.
Fragments of coal occur among the pebbles.
The sands and gravels dip rapidly to the S.W., and pass
under an Upper boulder clay. <i>The Upper Boulder Clay</i>
consists of a compact mass of clay with erratics scattered
through it; but the erratics are neither so abundant nor
so confusedly pressed together as in the lower bed.
Granite has been found, although rarely, associated with
the travelled felsites and quartzites, together with a few
flints; and local stones and blocks are also mixed up with
the clay&mdash;the clay itself however largely preponderating
and being available for brick making.</p>

<p>The series is capped by a mixture of clay, sand, and gravel
in varying proportions, which fills many hollows that have
been washed out of the upper clay; and must be regarded
as Post Glacial. Taking the general divisions indicated
by the California section, attention may be directed
to the following illustrative facts and sections. Glacial
striæ upon the surface of the rock have been noticed at
Weoley Hill Quarry close to California. The removal of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>a
mass of clay, sand, and gravel exposed a distinctly striated
surface of hardened Bunter Sandstone. The polished
surface dips towards the south west, in which direction
the principal striæ run, although there are several cross
striæ. The complete section shews (<i>a</i>) striated and
polished Bunter (altitude 520 feet above sea level); (<i>b</i>) thin
bed of marl; (<i>c</i>) sands and gravels (Middle Glacial); (<i>d</i>)
clay (Upper Boulder Clay).</p>

<p>A very large number of well-marked and finely
smoothed and polished grooves occur upon the blocks of
native rock which are strewn over the irregularly shaped
mass of basalt constituting Rowley Hill, Worcestershire.
Isolated grooved blocks rest upon the surface of the hill,
having been carried by external force into their present
position; but there is also, at Rowley Hall Quarry, a kind
of platform, capping the solid mass of basalt, which is
almost entirely composed of blocks with smoothed and
grooved surfaces, stiffly imbedded in clay.</p>

<p>The question has been raised whether, since the basalt
readily develops joints, these grooves may not be
rudimentary joints, or whether disintegration may not
have taken place along certain lines which have gradually
become grooves. I entertain no doubt, however, of their
glacial origin. No other explanation than that the
grooves were the work of moving ice can account, I
think, for their excellent polish, their frequent parallelism,
their adaptation to the hollows and protuberances of the
blocks they cross, and their predominant trend from north-east
to south-west. The absence of erratics from the
boulder clay in which the grooved basaltic blocks are
embedded is evidence of local ice action at Rowley Hill.
It is notable also that angular blocks of basalt from
Rowley Hill have been found in Birmingham, blocks which
must have travelled at least six miles.</p>

<p>It is often difficult to decide the precise age of the boulder
clays of the district; and whether any individual bed is
referred to the upper or the lower series is more dependent
upon the glacial theories that may be adopted than upon any
observations that can be made in the field. A <i>Boulder Clay</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of a typical kind, has been exposed at a brickyard, at the
bottom of Oak Street, Wolverhampton. This clay contains
an extraordinary number and variety of erratic blocks,
without question from the Lake District and south of
Scotland, a few flints, together with pebbles from the
Bunter beds. One of the sides of a boulder of felsite,
measuring 11 × 3 × 3ft., is flat and smooth, and covered
with parallel striæ. The sands and gravels rising in small
hillocks near the Cemetery, and slightly covering the clay
of the pit, are probably Middle glacial. A boulder clay,
formerly exposed at Icknield Street, Birmingham, while
presenting the same physical characteristics as the
Wolverhampton clay, differed from it widely in the nature
of the embedded erratic blocks. Instead of having
travelled from the Lake District or Scotland, a large
proportion were derived from rocks that occur <i>in situ</i> at
the Berwyn and Arenig Hills. The condition of the New
Red Sandstone ridge, against which this boulder clay rested,
was remarkable. The sandstone rock was broken up, and
large fragments of it were lifted out of their position and
thrust into the middle of the drift.</p>

<p>The changes of level which occurred during the glacial
epoch are shown by the deposits at Frankley Hill. In
the clays and sands cut through by the Halesowen Railway
only a few erratics (felsites) were found; but on the
summit of the section they are abundant and of large
size (<i>e.g.</i>, 4 × 4 × 2ft.) Professor Bonney, who has
examined them, feels certain they must have come from
Wales, having seen nothing like them in the Lake District.
Their height is nearly 800ft. above the sea level.
Were these erratics brought by land ice, the alteration in
the physical geography of the country must have been
enormous to have enabled a glacier to have moved downwards
over this point; were they dropped from icebergs,
the land must have been depressed to the extent of at
least 900ft., to form a sea in which the bergs could have
floated.</p>

<p>Turning to the <i>Middle Glacial Clays, Sands, and Gravels</i>,
these may be seen more or less developed in almost every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
section cut through undulating ground; and they are
occasionally twisted and contorted. In the immediate
neighbourhood of Birmingham they are not fossiliferous.</p>

<p>At Ketley, near Wellington (Shropshire) however,
fossiliferous sands and gravels occur, which I am inclined
(provisionally) to assign to this period. They rest upon a
bed containing erratic blocks of granite, and other rocks of
northern origin; and I collected from them 13 species of
mollusca. Only one species was peculiarly northern
(<i>astarte borealis</i>) but all in the group have an arctic range
of habitat. The elevation of these beds is about 357 feet
above the sea.</p>

<p>At Fox Hall Field, New Lodge, Lilleshall (Shropshire)
in a pit worked for sand, 463 feet above the sea, Mr.
Woodward discovered 21 species of mollusca, three&mdash;viz.,
<i>Dentalium abyssorum</i>, <i>Natica affinis</i>, and <i>Astarte borealis</i>&mdash;being
characteristically arctic and extinct in British waters.</p>

<p><i>The Upper Boulder Clay</i> is worked for bricks in many
localities. It is distinguished from the Lower Boulder
Clay, by having erractic blocks sparsely scattered through
it. It is often very compact and tenacious. No fossils
have as yet been found in it; unless indeed a clay derived
from a drain in a street at Wolverhampton, in which I
detected fragments of <i>Tellina balthica</i>, the spine of an
<i>Echinus</i>, <i>Polymorphina lactea</i>, and <i>Polystomella crispa</i>,
may be assigned to this division of the epoch.</p>

<p>The extraordinary <i>dispersion of erratic blocks</i> over the
surface of the ground remains to be noticed, and constitutes
one of the most remarkable phenomena in local
glacial geology. I distinguish the boulders resting on the
surface of the ground from those embedded in the clay
beds, although it is of course possible and probable that
the clay has been largely denuded, and the boulders have
thus been left exposed. Many of these erratic blocks
may therefore belong to the Lower Boulder Clay; while
others may have fallen from the icebergs which during the
proved subsidence of the land must have floated over the
“Midland” sea, and have been deposited in the Upper
boulder clay, while it was in process of accumulation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<p>How far the dispersion of erratics over the Midlands
may be referred to the ice sheet of some geologists, or to the
icebergs of the Archipelago period in the history of Great
Britain, must, at present, be regarded as an open question.</p>

<p>The Midland erratics have undoubtedly travelled from
three distinct regions, viz., (1) from Wales, (2) the western
part of the Lake district, and (3) Kirkcudbrightshire.
Boulders from the more easterly part of the Lake district,
such as the Snap granite boulders, so abundantly spread
over Yorkshire, have not been found in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The peculiar distribution of the Midland erratics is noteworthy.
Commencing at Bushbury Hill (a little to the north
of Wolverhampton, on the table land facing towards the
N.W.) the Lake rocks and the Scotch rocks&mdash;Criffell
granites and Eskdale granites&mdash;are largely intermingled.
Journeying westwards, a stream of boulders from Wales
crosses the northern streams. On and around the Clent
Hills (1023 feet) south west of Birmingham, Welsh felsites
are the only boulders to be found. Birmingham itself being
in the rear of the higher part of the table land on which
it stands, is in a kind of protected district, so far as the
northern stream of boulders is concerned, and the erratics
in its immediate vicinity are chiefly Welsh felsites; a few
fragments however of granite are occasionally found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Post Glacial Beds.</span>&mdash;The most complete section of
post glacial beds in this locality was obtained during
excavations made at Shustoke, near Birmingham; when
a bed of black peat, containing the remains of <i>Elephas
antiquus</i>, <i>Cervus elephas</i>, and <i>Bos primigenius</i>, with
hazel nuts and fragments of wood, was discovered 7ft. 6in.
beneath the surface. The section was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="PETROGRAPHY" id="PETROGRAPHY"></a>PETROGRAPHY.<br />
Notes on the Igneous and Metamorphic Rocks
of the Birmingham District.</h3>

<p class="author">BY S. ALLPORT, F.G.S.</p>

<p>The space available for some account of the crystalline
rocks being strictly limited, it would be useless to attempt
anything more than a brief general description of the
most important and interesting varieties. Fortunately
there is abundance of material, for Birmingham, as a
central point, affords unusual facilities for the study of
this branch of petrology. Although the rocks here
described appear to be scattered over a rather wide area,
it will be found that every locality mentioned may not
only be easily reached from one of the railway stations,
but that a good series of specimens may be collected and
the return journey made within the same day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Malvern Hills.</span>&mdash;It was clearly shown by
Dr. Holl, in 1865, (Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc., Vol. xxi.) that
the central portion or axis of this chain of hills consists of
a great series of true crystalline schists, among which the
prevailing types are hornblendic and micaceous gneiss,
hornblende-schist, mica-schist, and a quartzo-felspathic
rock, all of which are more or less distinctly foliated.
There is, however, great variety in the relative proportions
of the constituents; in many places either the hornblende
or the mica are nearly, or even quite absent; the felspar
and quartz then form the mass of the rock. In the
quarries on the east side of the North Hill, beautiful
examples of hornblende and felspar rock are abundant;
they contain more or less quartz, with a little mica, and
occasionally pass by insensible gradations from a well-marked
gneissic structure into a coarsely crystalline mass
in which foliation is no longer apparent. These latter
are, however, exceptional cases, and there can, I think,
be no doubt that we have here, in the Midlands, a
considerable exposure of the oldest type of foliated
crystalline schists, or as they are now frequently c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>alled
Pre-Cambrian or Archæan rocks. The rocks of the North
Hill are probably the oldest; they have been much
disturbed, and are generally the most coarsely crystalline
of the series. The more basic portions have suffered a
considerable amount of alteration; the secondary constituents,
chlorite and epidote, become abundant, and
occasionally the hornblende has been completely
replaced by the latter mineral; the rock then becomes an
epidote schist of a pale-yellowish colour. In Swinyards
Hill there is a micaceous gneiss with garnets, and in
Raggedstone Hill there are interesting varieties of contorted
mica-schist containing a large proportion of quartz.
Dykes of intrusive rocks occur in nearly all the hills, but
become far more numerous towards the north; they are
very uniform in appearance, and are probably altered
dolerites or diorites; very few specimens have been
examined, and they belong to the former group. In the
North Hill there are some masses of true diorite, but
their relation to the hornblendic gneisses with which they
are associated has not been clearly established.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mount Sorrel Granite.</span>&mdash;The granite is of two
varieties, red and grey, the difference being due to the fact,
that in the red masses, the partially decomposed felspar has
been coloured by ferric oxide. The rock is a hornblendic
granite, the constituents being quartz, felspar, biotite,
hornblende and titanite, with magnetite and a little
apatite. The felspars are orthoclase and plagioclase;
the former is much decomposed, while the plagioclase
frequently remains clear, and exhibits well its twin
striation. Biotite was originally abundant, but is very
frequently replaced by a clear green substance, which
is strongly dichroic, the two colours being grass-green,
and clear yellow. The hornblende has been greatly
decomposed; clear crystals are, however, not uncommon,
and exhibit the usual optical characters of the mineral.
The products of alteration are chlorite and epidote.
The titanite appears in reddish-brown grains, but is
not very abundant. In 1879, the writer discovered
the junction of the granite with the sedimentary <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>rocks,
and proved that the former was intrusive (Geol. Mag.
dec. ii., Vol. vi., p. 181). The junction occurs in Brazil
Wood, where there is a small quarry, in which granite
veins may be seen to penetrate the strata in various
directions; a large mass of granite is also within a few
yards. Some of the phenomena of <i>contact metamorphism</i>
may here be readily studied, the granite having converted
the slate into a crystalline micaceous schist, quite similar
in character to those produced under like conditions
round the granite in Cornwall and elsewhere. Small
garnets occur in the altered slates, and also in the granite
close to the junction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Charnwood Syenites.</span>&mdash;The Syenites and other
igneous rocks of Charnwood, have been described by
Messrs. Hill and Bonney (Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc.
Vol. xxxiv., p. 199.) The original constituents are
felspar, hornblende, quartz, apatite, ilmenite, magnetite
and titanite. The felspar is of two kinds, orthoclase
and plagioclase, the former is very turbid and decomposed,
while the plagioclase is clear, and retains its
usual optical characters. The curious intercrystallization
of quartz and felspar, known as <i>micropegmatite</i>, is common
in the masses of syenite near Groby; the best examples,
however, have been found by the writer in the Markfield
rock, where it appears to form a ground-mass in which the
larger crystals of orthoclase and plagioclase are enclosed.
A small portion of the hornblende is still characteristic,
but the greater portion appears in various stages of decomposition;
the alteration products being chlorite and
epidote. Titanite is by no means rare, and occurs in
well formed twin crystals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diorites of Atherstone and Nuneaton.</span>&mdash;A careful
examination of many specimens collected by the
writer from the various masses marked in the map 63
S.W. of the Geological Survey shows clearly that they are
diorites, the characteristic constituents being hornblende
and a triclinic felspar; these minerals, together with magnetite
and apatite are invariably present, and in addition,
a little orthoclase is seldom absent. The best speci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>men
examined is from a quarry near Marston Jabet; it is a
fine-grained rock, similar to a basalt in external appearance,
but contains numerous crystals of hornblende and plagioclase
which are generally quite unaltered. The clear
brown crystals of hornblende are unusually well developed,
and afford excellent opportunities of examining their
crystallographic and optical characters. There are also
present many grains of magnetite, and a few needles of
apatite. The only product of alteration is a little calcite
in the spaces between the crystals. Other specimens from
the same quarry will perhaps give a better idea of the
general character of the rocks of the district, and they
possess a special interest, as they afford unusually good
examples of successive stages of alteration. In one
specimen the constituents are well preserved, the plagioclase
is clear and exhibits its characteristic twin striation;
the hornblende is, for the most part, unaltered, but is
much fissured, and occasionally contains so many cavities
that the crystals are little more than skeletons. A ground-mass
in which the constituents were set has been highly
altered, and now consists of a fine granular substance,
partly serpentinous, with here and there a little calcite.
A second example is quite similar in texture to the last;
the felspar, still recognisable as triclinic, has been partially
converted into a grey turbid substance. The hornblende
occurs in various stages of alteration; some crystals are
but slightly attacked, while others are to a considerable
extent replaced by a pale green serpentinous substance.
The alteration has followed the cleavage-lines and fractures,
while the numerous cavities just mentioned are also filled
by the same substance. In a single slice there may be
seen almost every degree of change from a slight marginal
erosion to a mere skeleton of the original. Of the latter,
however, some little is always left; and whether the
alteration be little or great, the crystalline forms are perfectly
preserved. In a third specimen the alteration has
proceeded still further, the whole of the hornblende
crystals having been completely converted into pale green
pseudomorphs; they were originally large and well develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>ed,
and their forms are still perfectly sharp and
distinct. The felspar is here quite turbid and opaque,
and the interstitial ground-mass is represented by calcite.</p>

<p><i>Purley Park, near Atherstone.</i>&mdash;The rock here contains,
in addition to the usual brown hornblende, many
crystals and grains of clear yellowish augite, and several
pseudomorphs after olivine. The augite crystals exhibit
the usual forms, some being twins. The pseudomorphs
after olivine are quite similar to others observed in certain
highly altered dolerites, they consist of calcite or calcite
and viridite; they are numerous, and are generally larger
than the crystals of augite or hornblende.</p>

<p><i>Quarry close to Atherstone.</i>&mdash;This rock also contains
both augite and hornblende; and lastly, in the railway
cutting at Chilvers Coton, several interesting varieties
of diorite may be found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rhyolites of the Wrekin near Wellington,
Shropshire.</span>&mdash;In the large quarry in Lawrence Hill, at
the north end of the Wrekin, and at Lea Rock on the
Shrewsbury Road, are to be found some of the most
beautiful varieties of ancient volcanic glassy rocks hitherto
discovered in Britain. The rocks in their present condition
do not look like glass, owing to a process of devitrification,
which they have evidently undergone. There
can, however, be no room for doubt as to their original
vitreous condition, for they exhibit, under the microscope,
certain peculiar perlitic and spherulitic varieties of structure,
associated with characteristic forms of microliths, which
are found only in the pitchstone and obsidian varieties of
volcanic glass. In the quarry in Lawrence Hill, thick beds
of volcanic ashes and agglomerates are to be seen dipping
towards the north at a high angle, and an examination of
this hill and the Wrekin shows that they both consist of
a series of stratified ashes alternating with several flows of
rhyolite. One of the ash beds contains numerous
spheroidal blocks of thoroughly characteristic varieties of
glassy rocks; they have not yet been described, but it
may here be stated that, in addition to many typical
varieties of known rhyolites, there are also include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>d among
them some of the rarer glassy kinds described by Zirkel
in his Petrography of the 40th Parallel. Beautiful
examples of the spherulitic and perlitic varieties may be
found at Lea Rock, and have been described by the writer
in the Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc. Vol. xxxiii., p. 449. It has
been shown by Dr. Callaway, that all these rhyolites are
of Pre-Cambrian age; we have here, therefore, the clearest
proof that, during very early geological periods volcanic
action was of the same kind, and produced the same results,
as in more recent times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">South Staffordshire.</span>&mdash;The igneous rocks of the
South Staffordshire coalfield belong to the basic series,
and are, without exception, dolerites or basalts, the latter
being merely a fine grained variety of the former. They
have been intruded among the coal measures and shales,
and are frequently found in an excellent state of preservation.
The original mineral constituents are crystals, or
crystalline grains of triclinic felspar, augite, olivine, magnetite,
ilmenite, and apatite. These minerals are very
frequently quite unaltered, with the exception of the
olivine, which is often partly converted into serpentine;
this is the pale green substance seen along the cracks, and
around the sides of the grains; generally, however, the
decomposition has been continued until the formation of
complete serpentinous pseudomorphs after olivine has
been the result. The Hailstone Hill, near Rowley Church,
is the best locality for varieties in texture and composition,
as also for contemporaneous veins. In the large quarry
there is a very coarsely crystalline variety containing large
flat plates of ilmenite, and here also may be found some
light-coloured veins in which orthoclase is the predominant
felspar. The writer has also found in the same quarry
vessicular and amygdaloidal varieties of the rock. It need
scarcely be mentioned that, minute details of structure
and composition can only be studied in thin slices under
the microscope. Rocks of similar character to the above
occur in the following localities:&mdash;Pouk Hill, near Walsall;
Titterston Clee Hill (sheet 55, N.W.), Knowl Hill, near
Kinlet (sheet 55, N.E.), and Swinnerton Park, eight mil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>es
N.E. of Stafford. For fuller descriptions of these rocks,
see Allport, Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc., Vol. xxx., p. 529.</p>

<h3><a name="Mining_Statistics" id="Mining_Statistics"></a>Mining Statistics of the South Staffordshire
Coalfield.</h3>

<p class="author">By PROFESSOR W. E. BENTON, A.R.S.M., F.G.S.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerals Worked.</span>&mdash;The principal minerals worked
within the limits of the South Staffordshire Coalfield are
coal, ironstone, and fireclay from the Carboniferous
formations, and limestone from the underlying Silurian
rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Coal</span> is bituminous, non-caking, and much of it
contains a high percentage of water and oxygen. Some
of the seams produce excellent house-coal, others manufacturing
and steam coal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ironstone</span> is an argillaceous carbonate of iron,
occurring as nodules in the roofs of the coal seams, or as
thin beds within them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fireclay</span>, particularly in the neighbourhood of
Stourbridge, has a high refractory power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quantity of Minerals Raised.</span>&mdash;The annual produce
of minerals during the last twenty years has remained
without any considerable alteration. The Government
Mineral Statistics for 1885 are not yet published, but in
1884 the quantities of minerals raised in South Staffordshire
Coalfield were:&mdash;Coal, 9,688,047 tons; ironstone,
116,951 tons; fireclay, 205,320 tons; limestone (no
statistics given). The respective values of these minerals
at the mines were estimated at:&mdash;coal, £2,785,313;
ironstone, £62,974; fireclay, £42,781.</p>

<p>The total number of persons employed at the mines
during the same period was 23,782.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Destination of the Minerals.</span>&mdash;The greater part
of the coal is consumed in the district for house purposes,
for steam raising, for the manufacture of bricks, pottery,
glass, salt, &amp;c. The remainder is carried out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
coalfield into the south and south-western districts of
England by the London and North Western, Great
Western, and Midland Railway Companies, for house and
steam purposes. The gas coals and coke used in the
Birmingham district are not the product of the South
Staffordshire Coalmeasures, but are brought principally
from North Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The whole of the ironstone raised is smelted within the
district, in addition to large quantities of iron ore (hydrated
oxide) brought from the Northampton and North
Staffordshire mines. The manufacture of pig iron has
within the last decade decreased to such an extent that
less than one-third of the existing furnaces of South
Staffordshire are at present in blast.</p>

<p>The quantity of pig produced in the coalfield in 1884,
was 356,873 tons; in the reduction of which 810,936 tons
of coal (including coal converted into coke) were used, or
about 45½ cwts. of coal to one ton of pig iron. The
whole of the pig iron is retained in the district. The
finished iron trade retains its importance, more than one-third
of the existing puddling furnaces and rolling mills in
Great Britain occur within the limits of the South
Staffordshire Coalfield.</p>

<p>The finished iron is produced from local pig iron, and
from pig iron brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and
North Staffordshire. The steel production in South
Staffordshire is gradually increasing. The processes
adopted are those known as the Bessemer, Gilchrist and
open hearth.</p>

<p>The South Staffordshire fireclay is worked principally
in the neighbourhood of Brettle Lane and Stourbridge,
and is employed in the production of firebricks, gas retorts,
pottery, etc. Much also is conveyed into other districts
in a raw condition for pottery purposes.</p>

<p>The Silurian limestone is worked partly in open work
in the neighbourhood of Dudley, and partly by ordinary
underground mining operations at the Wren’s Nest,
Sedgley, and at Walsall.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Characteristic Features of the Mining of
South Staffordshire.</span>&mdash;There are several noteworthy
features in the mining of South Staffordshire. A stranger
is especially impressed with the large number of separate
collieries in working (about 600) in proportion to the
quantity of mineral raised. This peculiarity is due
essentially to the insignificant depth at which the minerals
occur below the surface (indeed, at Foxyard, near Tipton,
coal has long been quarried in an outcrop of the 10 yard
seam). This “Shallow Mining” has passed its meridian.
The future mining of the district is forecast by those
remarkable operations on the “red ground,” forming
the eastern side of the coalfield. The most recently
opened seam in the red ground is at Hampstead, three
miles north of Birmingham, where coal mining is carried
on below the Permian and Triassic, at a depth of more
than 600 yards.</p>

<p>Another feature of the mining is the unique South
Staffordshire mode of getting coal in the ten yard seam,
called “Square Work.” This method has met with much
condemnation from strangers, but after trial of other
methods, it still dominates. A further and most strongly
marked peculiarity of the South Staffordshire area is the
tendency of some of the Black Country coals to spontaneous
ignition. Much coal has thus in times past been sacrificed;
but a better acquaintance with the causes of this phenomenon
has led to measures which have reduced and which
must still further reduce this sacrifice of wealth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mines’ Drainage.</span>&mdash;In the Tipton and Old Hill
districts many of the coal mines are water-logged. In 1873
a Parliamentary Commission however was appointed to
drain this area, and was empowered to levy rates to defray
the drainage expenses. The drainage area under the
direction of this Mines’ Drainage Commission is 50
square miles. The principal pumping stations are the
Moat, the Stoneheath Station, and the Bradley Station.
The Bradley pumping engines (a quarter of a mile from
Moxley on the Great Western Railway) are of the compound
type having 52-inch and 90-inch steam cylinders.
These engines, with a 10 feet stroke, and six st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>rokes per
minute, work two 27-inch plunger pumps, and raise from
a depth of 126 yards more than 4,000,000 gallons of
water per 24 hours. As a result of this gallant effort to
recover these water-logged minerals, the number of pumping
stations has been gradually reduced in the Tipton
district from 77 in 1873 to 10 in 1885, and the quantity
of water from 23,000,000 to 10,000,000 of gallons daily.
To meet the inevitable expenses, a rate of 9d. per statute
ton is levied on all coals, slack, and ironstone; 3d. per
statute ton on all fireclay and limestone, and 1d. per statute
ton for surface drainage on all minerals, raised in the
Tipton district. In the Old Hill district a much lower
mines’-drainage rate is collected.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_IV" id="PART_IV"></a>PART IV.<br />
ZOOLOGY.</h2>

<p class="author">UNDER THE GENERAL EDITORSHIP OF W. R. HUGHES, F.L.S.</p>

<h3><a name="Introduction_IV" id="Introduction_IV"></a><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span></h3>

<p>It is believed that this is the first attempt to give a
connected account of the Zoology of the neighbourhood
of Birmingham, although the Botany of the District has
long attracted diligent and enthusiastic workers. The
subject, however, has not been neglected, and past and
present members of the Birmingham Natural History
and Microscopical Society, and other naturalists, have
from time to time made public, in the <i>Midland Naturalist</i>
and elsewhere, their observations on the more important
classes of the animal kingdom. Some of the classes in
the sub-kingdoms, <span class="smcap">Protozoa</span>, <span class="smcap">Cœlenterata</span>, <span class="smcap">Vermes</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Arthropoda</span> (it is to be regretted) have been almost
entirely neglected.</p>

<p>The limited amount of space allotted to Zoology in the
present volume and the limited amount of time at the
disposal of the contributors have prevented the presentation
of complete lists in all the divisions selected, although
the Editor believes that the various papers now submitted
furnish&mdash;so far as they go&mdash;a very fair, if not an exhaustive
account of our local fauna. It would have been desirable
to have discussed, more fully than is done by the various
contributors, the question of the Geographical distribution
of animals in the district, but this question, for the reasons
above stated, must be left until another occasion. The
division of the <span class="smcap">Microscopic Fauna</span> has been made
somewhat arbitrarily, in order to meet local circumstances.
It is hoped that at some future time these papers may be
extended, and become the foundation for a complete
record of the Zoology of the district.</p>

<p>Without any invidious comparison, the Editor may say
that, in the domain of local zoology, by far the most systematic
study has been that devoted during many years by
Mr. Thomas Bolton, F.R.M.S., to the microscopic fauna
of the neighbourhood. The number of new species which
this able and industrious naturalist has added to sci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>ence,
probably equals if not exceeds that of the discoveries recorded
in any other part of England during the time Mr.
Bolton has been an observer. Moreover, his novel and
successful method of disseminating these organisms among
microscopists, has contributed largely to scientific knowledge,
not only in England, but on the Continent, and
even in America.</p>

<p>Although not coming within the category of the local
fauna, very fine collections of the classes <span class="smcap">ECHINODERMATA</span>
and <span class="smcap">CRUSTACEA</span> have been made by Mr. G. Sherriff Tye, of
Richmond Road, Handsworth, who will be happy to show
the same to members of the British Association. His
excellent collection of <span class="smcap">MOLLUSCA</span>, many of which are
noticed in this volume, will also be on view.</p>

<p>The Entomological collection made by Mr. W. G. Blatch&mdash;the
work of a lifetime&mdash;many specimens of which are
referred to in this volume, will similarly be on view, on
application to Mr. Blatch, at Green Lane, Small Heath.
It is right to state that this naturalist has added very
many new species to the fauna of the district. The
Coleoptera occurring in the Midlands will be exhibited by
Mr. Blatch in Bingley Hall.</p>

<p>The collection of local fishes taken by members of
the Birmingham and Midland Piscatorial Association
(established in 1879) of which Mr. James Gregory is
Honorary Secretary, contains some very handsome and
well-mounted specimens which may ordinarily be seen
in the Society’s Room, at the Grand Hotel, on application
to Mr. Field, the proprietor. The collection for the
present forms part of the Exhibition in Bingley Hall. It
should be mentioned that this Association has done good
work in stocking the River Trent with about 35,000
Trout fry (<i>Salmo fario</i>) during the last few years.</p>

<p>The Editor offers no apology for mentioning the exceptionally
fine Ornithological collection of Mr. R. W.
Chase, President of the Birmingham Natural History
and Microscopical Society. The collection comprises, in
sequence, the eggs, and the birds in various stages of
growth towards maturity. The specimens are mounted so
as to show instructively the surroundings of the vari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>ous
birds as seen in their natural habitats. Mr. Chase will be
happy to show his collection to members of the British
Association, on application at his residence, Southfield,
7, Edgbaston Road, Edgbaston.</p>

<p>Although Birmingham is nearly the central part of
England, and thus farthest removed from the sea, it may
not be uninteresting to state that some attention has
been given to Marine Zoology, the Birmingham Natural
History and Microscopical Society having several times
made excursions to parts of the coast for the purpose of
dredging specimens. The <span class="smcap">PENNATULIDA</span>, dredged by the
Society, at Oban, in 1881, were described by Professor
A. Milnes Marshall, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.S., and Mr. W. P.
Marshall, M.I.C.E., in a Report, with illustrations by the
authors, published in the “Midland Naturalist” for 1882,
which gained the Darwin Gold Medal, awarded by the
Midland Union of Natural History Societies, at the
sixth annual meeting, held at Tamworth, in 1883. The
specimens may be seen in the annexe of the Exhibition,
at Bingley Hall.</p>

<p>The limit of radius of about twenty miles round
Birmingham, including parts of the counties of Warwick,
Worcester, and Stafford, chosen by the botanists who
have contributed to the present work, has been generally
accepted by the zoologists except in the division of
the <span class="smcap">Mollusca</span>, which is mainly confined to a radius
of twelve miles, as fixed by local Conchologists several
years ago. Some latitude has however been allowed, to
meet exceptional cases, necessitated by the wider range
of animals as compared with that of plants.</p>

<p>The thanks of the Editor are due to the various local
contributors, and especially to Mr. E. de Hamel, late
President of the Tamworth Natural History Society,
for his kind co-operation in furnishing the chapter on
Mammals and Reptiles. In strict order of classification,
the division of Reptiles should have followed that of
Birds, but for convenience in the present arrangement it
has not been thought desirable to separate this chapter.</p>

Mammals and Reptiles.</h3>

<p class="author">BY E. DE HAMEL.</p>

<h4>I.&mdash;MAMMALS.</h4>

<p>The district around Birmingham is admirably suited
for our native animals, abounding as it does with fertile
and well-watered valleys, wild moorlands, and extensive
woods; on the other hand, its large population renders
the prolonged existence of individual and striking rarities
well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>The value of the matter contained in this chapter has
been much enhanced by the personal observations of
many of the best Midland naturalists.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Cheiroptera.</span></h5>

<p>Adopting the late Professor Bell’s classification of
British quadrupeds and reptiles, the Bats come first under
consideration; and out of the fourteen species described
by him, no fewer than nine are to be found in this
district. The Noctule or Great Bat, <i>Scotophilus noctula</i>,
is the largest of our British species, and is characterised
by its lofty flight. There is a colony of these Bats in the
roof of Cliff Hall, near Kingsbury, and another in a hollow
of a lime tree in the Moat House Avenue, Tamworth.
The Hairy-armed Bat, <i>S. Leisleri</i>, which has a zig-zag
flight, occurs on the Warwickshire Avon. The Common
Bat, or Flittermouse, <i>S. pipistrellus</i>, is often seen flying
near buildings in broad daylight, and secretes itself in
crevices. The Reddish-grey Bat, <i>Vespertilio nattereri</i>,
is found in roofs of churches and similar buildings.
Daubenton’s Bat, <i>V. Daubentonii</i>, flies close to the
surface of water, and has been seen flying both at mid-day
and dusk over the River Anker at Tamworth, and is
abundant at Stratford-on-Avon; it hides in trees and
buildings. The Whiskered Bat, <i>V. mystacinus</i>, frequents
the sheltered side of high hedges, and secretes itself in
any convenient chink. The Long-eared Bat, <i>Plecotus
auritus</i>, possesses ears nearly as long as its hea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>d and
body combined, and is generally distributed; it collects
in clusters under tiled roofs and in church towers. The
Barbastelle Bat, <i>Barbastellus Daubentonii</i>, is not uncommon
in Warwickshire; it flutters lazily round moving
objects, and hides in crevices. The last local species
is the Lesser Horse-shoe Bat, <i>Rhinolophus hipposideros</i>,
which is gregarious, and haunts roofs of houses; it is
easily distinguished by its curious nasal appendage.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Insectivora.</span></h5>

<p>The Hedgehog, <i>Erinaceus Europæus</i>, common everywhere,
hibernates in a nest of leaves. The Mole, <i>Talpa
Europæa</i>; abundant, pied and light coloured varieties
plentiful. The Common Shrew, <i>Sorex vulgaris</i>, often,
found dead on pathways. The Water Shrew, <i>S. fodiens</i>,
is more rare, but has been found near Tamworth, at Great
Barr, and in the Birmingham Botanical Gardens. The
Lesser Shrew, <i>S. pygmæus</i>, is omitted, as it is now
generally considered to be but a variety of <i>S. fodiens</i>.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Carnivora.</span></h5>

<p>The Badger or Brock, <i>Meles taxus</i>, whilst rare, is very
equally distributed over the district. On April 14th,
1877, one was obtained in the Foxhole Hill, in Bentley
Big wood, near Atherstone; a female and three young
ones were taken alive in the spring of 1884, in a wood,
near Croxall; there are some more badgers in the
same wood this year, 1886. In March, 1885, a single
one was captured at Bentley, near Redditch; the keeper
at Beaudesert reports that they are still plentiful on
Cannock Chase. The Otter, <i>Lutra vulgaris</i>, like the
Badger, though rare, still frequently occurs in the Midlands,
especially on the rivers Anker, Tame, and Trent, and
their tributaries; as well as the Warwickshire Avon. On the
Tame, a few years since, a female Otter and brood of
young ones was seen several times swimming near an osier
bed in the Cliff meadows; another was shot when crossing
the river at the back of Broad Island, near Tamworth;
two young ones were killed in a hay field, close by H<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>opwas
Wood; and a large Otter was found in a brook at
Wigginton, a mile from the river, and destroyed after a
desperate encounter; still another was seen trotting along
the banks of the Tame, close by the town of Tamworth;
while the largest Otter known to have been taken in the river
Avon was captured on the first of June, 1886, at its junction
with the river Arrow; it weighed 28lbs. The Weasel, <i>Mustela
vulgaris</i>, and the Stoat, <i>M. erminea</i>, are both plentiful.
The Polecat or Fitchet, <i>M. putorius</i>, is becoming decidedly
rare, only three having been recorded in the district
during the last few years; the first of these occurred at
Alvecote Wood, the second at Hints, in the neighbourhood
of Tamworth, and the third at Merivale, near Atherstone.
The Pine Marten, <i>Martes abietum</i>, although believed now
to be absolutely extinct in the Midlands, used to be found
in Needwood Forest, and a specimen taken many years
ago near Rugeley is now in the possession of Mr. R. W.
Chase. The Fox, <i>Vulpes vulgaris</i>, being strictly preserved,
is sufficiently abundant.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Rodentia.</span></h5>

<p>The Squirrel, <i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>, is thinly distributed,
and may occasionally be seen in most of the large woods,
as for instance, those in Sutton, Hagley, and Arbury
Parks, where the dreys are built on the forked branches
of the trees. The Dormouse, <i>Myoxus avellanarius</i>, is also
rare, but is occasionally met with by hedgers, when dressing
fences. As it is semi-gregarious, when one is found more
may be expected. The nest is built of grass, compact,
globular, about five inches in diameter, with the entrance
near the base. A nest was taken at Cofton Reservoir,
near Barnt Green, in April, 1885. The Harvest Mouse,
<i>Mus minutus</i>, is the smallest of our quadrupeds, building a
small round and firm nest among the ears of corn, or
stems of reeds. It is generally distributed, and has been
taken near Stratford-on-Avon, Merivale and Atherstone.
The long-tailed Field Mouse, <i>M. sylvaticus</i>, is plentiful,
and often turned up by the spade or plough. The
Common Mouse, <i>M. musculus</i>, abundant in b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>uildings.
The Black Rat, <i>M. rattus</i>, although rare, is still to be found
in small colonies, generally in the cellars of large towns,
where it is comparatively secure from the attacks of its
greatest enemy and destroyer, the Brown Rat. A single
recent example has been taken within the last six months
at New Parks, near Leicester, and is now in the possession
of Mr. F. T. Mott. The rarity of the occurrence justifies
this record, although the locality is outside the radius
agreed upon. The Brown Rat, <i>M. decumanus</i> is abundant
in both buildings and hedgerows. The Water Vole,
<i>Arvicola amphibius</i>, better known as the Water Rat, is
common on all the streams of the Midlands. The common
Field-Vole, <i>A. agrestis</i>, is plentiful in the meadows, where
their nests are frequently exposed by the mowers. The
Red Field or Bank-Vole, <i>A. glareolus</i>, is much more rare
and distinguished from the last species, by its rich chestnut
fur; several of these were taken at Belvoir Castle, in
July, 1885. The Hare, <i>Lepus timidus</i>, and the Rabbit,
<i>L. cuniculus</i>, have been greatly reduced in numbers since
the passing of the Hares and Rabbits Bill in 1881.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Ruminantia.</span></h5>

<p>The Red Deer, <i>Cervus elaphus</i>, as recently as 1800,
roamed wild over Cannock Chase and Needwood Forest,
but is now confined to the areas of the large parks, such
as Gopsall and Beaudesert. The Fallow Deer, <i>C. dama</i>,
formerly existed in thousands on Cannock Chase, and
is now the chief ornament of the parks. The Roe Deer,
<i>Capreolus caprea</i>, was also common, but has become
extinct. The Wild Cattle, <i>Bos taurus</i>, under the
fostering care of the Lords Ferrars, at Chartley, near
Stafford, still constitute the greatest curiosity among
the Midland mammals. Garner, in his history of Staffordshire,
relates that these animals at one time roamed free
over Needwood Forest, and how, in the thirteenth century,
William de Ferrariis enclosed a thousand acres of high-lying
moorland, the turf of which is in the same condition
now as then, and within this enclosure the animals are
maintained in their pristine purity. At the present ti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>me
this herd consists of about thirty head, comprising three
bulls, the oldest aged nine years, a magnificent beast,
with deep chest, black muzzle and ears, black-tipped,
wide-spreading horns, and forefeet also flecked with black,
the prevailing colour being a rich creamy white. So
sensitive are these cattle, as the result of their high
breeding, that calves unduly handled are forsaken by their
mothers; and older beasts, if subjected to forcible
restraint, will often, as the keeper put it to the writer,
“just wag their tails and die.” When the calves are with
them the cows are dangerous to approach.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Pachydermata.</span></h5>

<p>Before leaving the local mammals, the celebrated red
breed of Tamworth Pigs, <i>Sus scrofa</i>, deserves mention
as one of the best, most useful, and healthy of the many
well-known kinds; but there is no reason to suppose
that it, any more than the others, can claim descent from
the reputed Wild Pigs of Needwood.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;REPTILES.</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Sauria.</span></h5>

<p>The Sand Lizard, <i>Lacerta agilis</i>, occurs in Leicestershire
and Worcestershire, and is to be met with on Cannock
Chase and similar localities. The Viviparous Lizard,
<i>Zootoca vivipara</i>, is found in Sutton Park, is smaller
and more active than the Sand Lizard, and differs from
that species inasmuch as the young are born alive.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Saurophidia.</span></h5>

<p>The Blindworm, <i>Anguis fragilis</i>, is not infrequent,
specimens have been obtained at Sutton Park, Merivale,
Baddesley Ensor, Beaudesert, the Forest of Wyre and
Habberley Valley, near Kidderminster.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<h5><span class="smcap">Ophidia.</span></h5>

<p>The Ringed Snake, <i>Natrix torquata</i>, is seldom seen
in the neighbourhood of Tamworth&mdash;although on one
occasion the occupants of a boat on the river Anker saw
one of these snakes glide down the bank and swim towards
them&mdash;it is common in Merivale Park, occasionally found
in Sutton Park, and near Dudley. The Viper or Adder,
<i>Pelias berus</i>, our only poisonous reptile, is locally common,
but generally rare; a large number were killed in Sutton
Park during the summer of 1884; it is plentiful on Chartley
Moss, Cannock Chase, and in the Forest of Wyre. The
Viper is shorter and thicker than the Common Snake, and
easily distinguished by the V shaped marking on the
head.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Anoura.</span></h5>

<p>The Common Frog, <i>Rana temporaria</i>, is very abundant,
and may be seen in hundreds in the ditches during
March. The Common Toad, <i>Bufo vulgaris</i>, is also
generally distributed.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Urodela.</span></h5>

<p>The Common Warty-Newt, <i>Triton cristatus</i>, may be
found in ponds throughout the district. The Smooth-Newt,
<i>Lissotriton punctatus</i>, is a habitant of every clear
horsepond, where it can be seen either basking on the
bottom, or rising to the surface for air; this species
often leaves the water, and hides under stones.</p>

Birds.</h3>

<p class="author">BY R. W. CHASE.</p>

<p>The district surrounding Birmingham does not present
any striking or special feature to the ornithologist; but
owing to its varied character, comprising as it does hill and
dale, with considerable stretches of moorland and a
plentiful supply of water, in rivers, reservoirs and pools, it
forms haunts particularly attractive to birds.</p>

<p>The number of local species recorded is large, consisting
of about sixty residents, forty-two migrants, and
eighty occasional and rare visitors; making a total of
one hundred and eighty-two species.</p>

<p>The large number of marine or littoral species occurring
so far inland is an interesting fact to be noted, and from
the records of such species as the Curlew Sandpiper,
Turnstone, Ring Dotterel, Common and Arctic Terns,
much valuable information might be brought to bear
upon some of the knotty problems of migration. It is
principally during autumn that such species are noticed,
and invariably the examples obtained are immature, or
birds of the year.</p>

<p>The classification and synonymy used in this brief
summary is in accordance with the fourth edition of
“Yarrell’s British Birds.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">SCOLOPACIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Red-necked Phalarope, <i>Phalaropus
hyperboreus</i>, has occurred once at Tamworth. Woodcock,
<i>Scolopax rusticula</i>, rare. Great Snipe, <i>Gallinago major</i>,
one obtained at Polesworth and another is said to have
been seen in Sutton Park(?). Common Snipe, <i>G. cœlestis</i>,

3,330, 3,388, 4,254). Common Sandpiper, <i>Totanus hypoleucus</i>,
summer visitor; it is probable this species breeds
in the district. Wood Sandpiper, <i>T. glareola</i>, very rare,
once occurred at the Sewage Farm. Green Sandpiper,
<i>T. ochropus</i>, has occurred at Packington, near Tamworth.
Redshank, <i>T. calidris</i>, rare; has occurred at the Sewage

<h4><span class="smcap">Gaviæ.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">LARIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Black Tern, <i>Hydrochelidon nigra</i>, often
occurs in spring and autumn. Sandwich Tern, <i>Sterna
cantiaca</i>, occasional visitor; more frequently observed
towards autumn. Common Tern, <i>Sterna fluviatilis</i>, often
observed during spring and autumn migration; chiefly
birds of the year during the latter period. Arctic Tern,
<i>S. macrura</i>, the same remarks apply to this species as to
<i>S. fluviatilis</i>. Sabine’s Gull, <i>Xema sabinii</i>, once occurred
near Coleshill, in October, 1883. Black-headed Gull,

<i>L. canus</i>, rare, has been shot near Alcester. Kittiwake
Gull, <i>Rissa tridactyla</i>, rare; occasionally seen during
winter. Pomatorhine Skua, <i>Stercorarius pomatorhinus</i>,
very rare; considering the unusual number of Skuas that
appeared during the autumn of 1879, it is rather surprising
that more examples were not noticed in this district,
very few being shot. Buffon’s Skua, <i>S. parasiticus</i>; an
immature bird was shot on Lichfield Racecourse in
October 1874.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Tubinares.</span></h4>

an immature bird was picked up exhausted in
the Chandos road in this town, September 5th, 1880.
Forked-tailed Petrel, <i>Cymochorea leucorrhoa</i>, very rare.
One picked up September 4th, 1883, dead in a yard, in
Guildford street in this town, and subsequently recorded
in the local papers as <i>Procellaria pelagica</i>. Stormy Petrel,
<i>P. pelagica</i>, has occurred too many times to particularize
each instance.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Pygopodes.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">ALCIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Little Auk, <i>Mergulus alle</i>, very rare; several
instances are on record of its occurrence in the district,
one was obtained in November, 1863. Puffin, <i>Fratercula
arctica</i>; one picked up in Broad street in this town, in an
exhausted condition, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">COLYMBIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Great Northern Diver, <i>Colymbus glacialis</i>,
very rare; one was obtained at Tipton, January 8th, 1877.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">PODICIPEDIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Great crested Grebe, <i>Podiceps cristatus</i>,
generally distributed throughout the district, and far from
rare; breeds regularly at Sutton Coldfield, Little Aston,
and Barnt Green. Sclavonian Grebe, <i>P. auritus</i>; one
shot at Sutton Coldfield, in December, 1868. Little
Grebe, <i>P. fluviatilis</i>, not rare; breeds sparingly in suitable
localities; small flocks or families are often observed
during the autumn and winter, especially on the river
Tame.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Steganopodes.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">PELECANIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Common Cormorant, <i>Phalacrocorax

one taken exhausted in a field of potatoes near
Tamworth.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Herodiones.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">ARDEIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Common Heron, <i>Ardea cinerea</i>, generally
to be met with. There are several Heronries in the
county of Warwick. Little Egret, <i>Ardea garzetta</i>, said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
have been obtained at Sutton Coldfield, many years ago.
Night heron, <i>Nycticorax griseus</i>, one obtained near
Alcester. Common Bittern, <i>Botaurus stellaris</i>, more
rare than formerly; a great many examples have been
obtained from time to time, especially in the neighbourhood
of Sutton Coldfield.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Odontoglossæ.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">PHŒNICOPTERIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Flamingo, <i>Phœnicopterus roseus</i>;
one stated to have been shot in the neighbourhood of
Wolverhampton, but probably an escaped bird.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Anseres.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">ANATIDÆ.</span>&mdash;Brent Goose, <i>Bernicla brenta</i>, scarce; two
shot at King’s Norton, October 24th, 1882, during stormy
weather; has also been obtained near Tamworth. Flocks
of geese are often observed passing overhead, but of
course it is impossible to determine to what species they
belong. Canada Goose, <i>B. canadensis</i>, has been shot
several times in the district, whether escaped specimens or
not, it is difficult to say, as this species is often kept in a
semi-wild state. Mute Swan, <i>Cygnus olor</i>, is to be found
upon many large pools and ornamental waters; breeds
here plentifully. Polish Swan, <i>C. immutabilis</i>, once occurred
at Earlswood reservoir. Ruddy Sheld-Duck, <i>Tadorna
casarca</i>, has been shot at Nechells, also at Yardley Wood;
probably escaped birds. Common Sheld-Duck, <i>T. cornuta</i>,
rare visitor. A magnificent male was shot at Hawkesbury,
near Coventry, in 1881. Mallard, <i>Anas boscas</i>, plentiful
on some pools; breeds throughout the district. Gadwall,
<i>A. strepera</i>, very rare; one shot near Lichfield in
December, 1873. Shoveller, <i>Spatula clypeata</i>, formerly
bred in Staffordshire, but very scarce of late years; one
shot at Sutton Coldfield, in 1867. Teal, <i>Querquedula
crecca</i>, sparingly met with, a few pairs breed in the
district; the nest has several times been taken in Sutton
Park. Widgeon, <i>Mareca penelope</i>, winter visitor; often
seen in large flocks upon the reservoirs and pools during
severe weather. Scaup, <i>Fuligula marila</i>, has occurr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>ed once
at Wichnor near Tamworth. Pochard, <i>F. ferina</i>, rare; has
been shot near Tamworth. Tufted Duck, <i>F. cristata</i>, very
rare; a male was shot in Aston Park many years ago, by a
gamekeeper of James Watt, Esq. Golden Eye, <i>Clangula
glaucion</i>, one shot near Tamworth. Goosander, <i>Mergus
merganser</i>, an accidental visitor in winter; specimens
obtained are generally either immature birds or females.
Red-breasted Merganser, <i>M. serrator</i>, very scarce; only
young birds have been obtained. Smew, <i>M. albellus</i>, very
rare. A female was shot on the canal at Selly Oak, about
fifteen years ago. Another example of this species was
obtained at Elford, near Tamworth.</p>

Fishes and Mollusca.</h3>

<p class="author">BY G. SHERRIFF TYE.</p>

<h4>I.&mdash;FISHES.</h4>

<p>The waters within easy reach of Birmingham afford
to those interested in the Natural History of Fishes excellent
opportunities for study, and are much resorted to
by anglers. To those who do not incline to the study of
fish or fishing, it will probably be a matter of surprise to
know the abundance and excellence of the individuals,
and the variety of species occurring within an hour’s walk
of the centre of our town. Of the river Tame, a well-known
angler states: “In my opinion this is a remarkable
little river; in three and a half miles it contains in abundance
at least ten species of fish, viz., trout, pike, chub,
tench, perch, roach, rudd, dace, gudgeon, minnow, all of
which, except the pike, attain to a size equal to any in rivers
or pools within a hundred miles of Birmingham.” Large
fish are not so common now as formerly, but probably
this river will recover, and attain its wonted excellence,
when the “Black Country” sewerage works are completed.</p>

<p>The river Cole is a fine trout stream. The river Blythe,
Coleshill, is an excellent stream, especially for eels. The
river Trent with its tributaries, the Anker, Tame, and Mease,
is celebrated for many species of fish, and is a great resort
of anglers. Earlswood and the Corporation reservoirs,
the pools at Sutton Coldfield, Great Barr Park, King’s
Norton, Barnt Green, and many others are all well stocked
with fish, and will render fine examples to all who seek them.</p>

<p>The writer’s thanks are cordially rendered to members
of the Birmingham Piscatorial Association and to other
gentlemen for valuable information, kindly given, respecting
the localities and habitats of Fishes. The weights of
the largest specimens recorded, have all been verified by
the anglers who have taken them.</p>

<p>The classification adopted in this paper is that of
“Yarrell’s British Fishes,” second edition, 1841.</p>

<p>The number of local species recorded is thirty-three.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>
<h5><span class="smcap">Acanthopterygii.</span></h5>

<p>Perch, <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>, accommodates itself to either
river or pool, the former producing the cleanest and handsomest
fish. It has been taken of fine size, 4½ lbs., Rotton
Park Reservoir; 3½ lbs., Tardebigg; 3 lbs., Rotton Park
Reservoir; 2 lbs. to 3 lbs. from Old Soho Pool, now the
site of a Railway Wharf.</p>

<p>Ruffe, <i>Acerina vulgaris</i>, not uncommon, river Trent,
Alrewas. The writer has taken a number from a pool
near Wednesbury.</p>

<p>Miller’s Thumb, <i>Cottus gobio</i>, is to be met with in most
of our little rivulets, lurking under stones.</p>

<p>The Rough-tailed three-spined Stickleback, <i>Gasterosteus
trachurus</i>; ubiquitous. The males in the breeding season
are resplendent in scarlet and green, and fight for
supremacy. It is remarkable with what ease individuals
accommodate themselves to sea water. The Smooth-tailed
Stickleback, <i>G. leiurus</i>; the Short-spined Stickleback, <i>G.
brachycentus</i>; the Four-spined Stickleback, <i>G. spinulosus</i>
and the Ten-spined Stickleback, <i>G. pungitius</i>; although
not so common as <i>G. trachurus</i>, are all found in ditches
communicating with the river Anker, at Tamworth.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Abdominal Malacopterygii.</span></h5>

<p>Carp, <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>. The writer has had one of large
size from Plants Brook Reservoir, 7½ lbs., and has seen a
larger one in the pool. The largest recorded was from
Sandwell Pool, 12 lbs.</p>

<p>Crucian Carp, <i>C. carassius</i>, is not uncommon; the
writer has seen numbers of them taken from small cattle
pits on a farm in Warwickshire. It is a pretty and hardy
species in an aquarium.</p>

<p>Gold Carp, <i>C. auratus</i>, the well known “gold-fish,” used
to breed in a pool at West Bromwich, into which warm water
from an engine flowed, but it is not found there now.</p>

<p>Barbel, <i>Barbus vulgaris</i>, is found in abundance in
the River Trent, but in general size not to be compared
with those taken in the Thames. River Trent, 7½ lbs.
and 8 lbs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>
<p>Gudgeon, <i>Gobio fluviatilis</i>, in streams fairly common,
also in canals, but rare in pools. Earlswood Reservoir.</p>

<p>Tench, <i>Tinca vulgaris</i>, not uncommon; of large size at
Handsworth, Sutton Coldfield, and near Barnt Green, in
pools; plentiful at the latter place, rivers Tame, Anker,
&amp;c.; 3 lbs. Edgbaston Pool. It is one of the easiest fishes
to keep in confinement. A golden variety of this species is
bred in the private pools of gentlemen in this country, it is
said to have been introduced from Germany. Fine specimens
were to be seen at the recent Fisheries Exhibition
in London.</p>

<p>Bream, <i>Abramis brama</i>, in the larger rivers. When this
species assembles, after an overnight’s baiting, it may often
be taken in great numbers. 5 lbs. River Trent. The
writer has known a few hours’ fishing in a Warwickshire
stream to yield sufficient fine fishes of this species to fill
a hamper as much as a couple of men could carry.</p>

<p>Roach, <i>Leuciscus rutilus</i>, occurs very commonly and of
large size; old Soho Pool, 3 lbs. weight, a truly noble fish;
Sharpley Reservoir, 2 lbs.</p>

<p>Dace, <i>Leuciscus vulgaris</i>, River Trent, 14 ozs.</p>

<p>Chub, <i>Leuciscus cephalus</i>, River Tame, 5½ lbs. 5 lbs.
and many approaching that weight.</p>

<p>Rudd or Red-eye, <i>Leuciscus erythropthalmus</i>. In the
River Tame.</p>

<p>Bleak, <i>Leuciscus alburnus</i>. In streams and in Earlswood
Reservoir. A friend remarks, “I have taken this species
in Earlswood Reservoir, and Gudgeon also, the only
instance I have met with where these two river fish
have occurred in a pool.” They were probably bred from
escaped bait.</p>

<p>Minnow, <i>Leuciscus phoxinus</i>, common in many streams.</p>

<p>Loach, <i>Cobitis barbatula</i>, is found in streamlets in many
places. The writer has taken it at Handsworth. It is
said to be delicate food.</p>

<p>The Spined-Loach, <i>Botia tænia</i>, is rarer than the
preceding. It has been taken in the Rivers Anker and
Tame at Tamworth.</p>

<p>Pike, <i>Esox lucius</i>, is found in large pools and rivers.
26 lbs.; 25 lbs. 6 oz., Earlswood Reservoir; 23 lbs., Middlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>on
Pool; 22 lbs. 6 oz., Pebble Mill Pool; 12 and 13 lbs.,
Sutton Park. The writer could relate many instances of
the voracity of the Pike, and incidents of sport,&mdash;one
must suffice. A Pike was hooked near some floodgates in
the Tame, and on taking out the hook he found that it had
gone through a Water-Shrew, which the fish had just
taken, and still held in its mouth.</p>

<p>Salmon, the king of British fishes, <i>Salmo salar</i>, comes
legitimately within our radius of twenty miles. It has
been taken from the Eel traps in the River Tame at
Tamworth; in the River Trent at Yoxall; and in the
River Severn at Bewdley. At the last mentioned place a
specimen weighing 40 lbs. has been captured.</p>

<p>Common Trout, <i>S. fario</i>, Bourne Brook, Fazeley,
7 lbs.; River Tame, 5½ lbs., 4 lbs. several, and many
below that weight; River Trent, 4 lbs. 2 ozs.; River Cole,
Packington.</p>

<p>Lochleven Trout, <i>S. Levenensis</i>. In April, 1884, the
Water Department of the Corporation of Birmingham
stocked their new reservoir (90 acres) at Shustoke with
3,000 of this fish. The reservoir at Witton was stocked with
2,000 fish at the same time. They were yearlings, about
3 inches long, and are now (August, 1886) from 2 lbs. to
3¼ lbs. in weight. These reservoirs will therefore in a
few years be good places for this species of Trout.</p>

<p>Grayling, <i>Thymallus vulgaris</i>, River Trent, Shenstone,
2 lbs.; Alrewas, 17 ozs.; Bourne Brook, Fazeley.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Subbrachial Malacopterygii.</span></h5>

<p>The Burbot, <i>Lota vulgaris</i>, the only British species of
the family of the Gadidæ that lives permanently in fresh
water, is found in the River Anker at Tamworth, the
largest fish recorded being 5 lbs.; 3 lbs. 2 ozs.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Apodal Malacopterygii.</span></h5>

<p>The Sharp-nosed Eel, <i>Anguilla acutirostris</i>, and the
Broad-nosed Eel, <i>Anguilla latirostris</i>. In rivers and
pools generally. Fine specimens of <i>A. acutirostris</i> are
taken in the River Blythe, some weighing 4 lbs. each.
The third species of Eel mentioned by Yarrell, the Sn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>ig,
<i>A. mediorostris</i>, occurs with the two others in the
Worcestershire Avon, and doubtless finds its way into the
Arrow and other tributary streams. It differs from the two
preceding species, being much smaller, individuals rarely
exceeding half a pound each; and in its habit of roving
and feeding by day. It is of superior flavour to its
congeners. The Snig may easily be distinguished by the
first five cervical vertebræ, which are smooth and free from
spinous processes, always present in the sharp-nosed and
broad-nosed Eels.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Chondropterygii.</span></h5>

<p>Lampern or river Lamprey, <i>Petromyzon fluviatilis</i>.
In the River Trent, and also the Tame and in streamlets,
Sutton Park, &amp;c.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;MOLLUSCA.</h4>

<p>The district around Birmingham is an excellent field
for terrestrial and fluviatile Mollusca. Within a circle
of twelve miles radius, which includes a portion of the
Counties of Warwick, Stafford, and Worcester, can be
found fifty per cent. of the species and varieties enumerated
in Dr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys’ “British Conchology.” No
special quality of soil or geological condition is required
for the existence of Molluscs; whatever the nature of the
ground may be, some species or other will reward the
searcher. The number of terrestrial species is usually
the greatest where limestone is present; indeed some
species do not seem able to maintain their existence
away from it, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Helix ericetorum</i>, <i>H. virgata</i>, <i>H.
arbustorum</i>, and <i>Cyclostoma elegans</i>. The still beautiful
grounds of Dudley Castle were once “happy hunting
grounds” for the collectors of Mollusca, but the smoke of
a thousand fires has cast a baleful influence over the
locality. The dead shells of species, once abundant, are
conclusive evidence that the Molluscan fauna do not now
enjoy a congenial atmosphere in that neighbourhood.
<i>Helix arbustorum</i>, may, notwithstanding, stil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>l be found
there, its nearest proximity to Birmingham.</p>

<p>Among the noticeable species of the district may be
mentioned <i>Testacella Haliotidea</i>, found in the garden of a
florist at Redditch; <i>Succinea virescens</i>, (Morelet) = <i>S. putris</i>
var. <i>vitrea</i> (Jeffreys), which the writer has taken near Plants
Brook Reservoir; <i>Zonites glaber</i>, found near Solihull;
<i>Helix Cantiana</i>,<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Henley-in-Arden; <i>H. virgata</i>, Grafton,
near Alcester; <i>Balia perversa</i>, Fenny Compton, Northamptonshire.
The three last named species are outside
the twelve miles radius.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Conchifera.</span></h5>

<p>The Midlands are rich in fluviatile forms, nearly all the
known British species occur. Those worth noting among
the Sphæriidæ are&mdash;<i>Sphærium corneum</i>, var. <i>Scaldiana</i>,
Acock’s Green; <i>S. corneum</i>, var. <i>flavescens</i>, Plants Brook;
<i>S. rivicola</i> and <i>S. ovale</i>, Acock’s Green and Rushall Canal.
<i>S. lacustre</i> is not uncommon, and is found abundantly in
a pond at Handsworth.</p>

<p>The Pisidia are well represented, four out of our five
species occurring. It is curious that the large form
<i>Pisidium amnicum</i> has not hitherto been taken in the
district. The writer took <i>P. roseum</i><a name="FNanchor_63_64" id="FNanchor_63_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> from several ponds at
Meriden in 1885-6.</p>

<p>The Unionidæ are extremely plentiful, and the two
species <i>Unio tumidus</i> and <i>U. pictorum</i> attain to an immense
size. In the writer’s cabinet are examples of <i>U. pictorum</i>
of the following dimensions&mdash;2¹⁄₁₆ in. × 5¹⁄₁₆, 2¹⁄₁₆ in. × 5¼,
2³⁄₁₆ in. × 5¼, some of them weighing nearly 4 ounces
avoirdupois; and of <i>U. tumidus</i>, 2⁵⁄₁₆ in. × 4¾, 2⅜ in. × 4⅞,
2¾ in. × 5, the weight of some examples reaching nearly
6 ounces avoirdupois. These are probably the finest
shells of their kind ever taken anywhere. <i>Anodonta
cygnea</i> is common, and its varieties <i>incrassata</i>, <i>Zellensis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
<i>pallida</i>, and <i>rostrata</i> occur. <i>A. anatina</i>, and the varieties
<i>radiata</i> and <i>ventricosa</i> are found; handsome shells of the
latter occur at Barr Park and in the river Blythe at
Coleshill. <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i> is commonly distributed.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Gasteropoda.</span></h5>

<p>In the order Pectinibranchiata, <i>Neritina fluviatilis</i>, the
only representative in England of a genus of world-wide
distribution, has occurred in the river Tame at Aston,
but the writer believes is not now to be found there. One
of our two species of Paludinidæ, <i>Paludina vivipara</i>,<a name="FNanchor_64_65" id="FNanchor_64_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
<i>Bythinia tentaculata</i>, <i>B. Leachii</i>, and <i>Valvata piscinalis</i>
make up the list of operculate water snails.</p>

<p>Among the Limnæidæ examples of the following genera
occur. In the genus Planorbis we find all the species
except <i>Planorbis lineatus</i>, excluding of course <i>P. dilatatus</i>
(Gould), which only occurs at Manchester, having been
introduced on cotton from America. The epiphragm
formed by <i>P. spirorbis</i>, in summer, when the solar heat
has dried up its habitat, is a singular item of its economy.
It is supposed that this habit enabled <i>P. dilatatus</i> to reach
our shores. <i>Physa hypnorum</i> and <i>P. fontinalis</i> are both
represented; they are charming inhabitants of an aquarium,
their habit of thread spinning,<a name="FNanchor_65_66" id="FNanchor_65_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_66" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> especially in the young
state, makes them lively creatures; the lobed mantle of
<i>P. fontinalis</i>, nearly enclosing the shell, gives a peculiar
character to the animal.</p>

<p>Of the six species of Limnæa<a name="FNanchor_66_67" id="FNanchor_66_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_67" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> which occur, it will not
be needful to mention more than one, which is the rarest
with us, viz.: <i>Limnæa glabra</i>. Both species of Anc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>ylus
are moderately common.</p>

<p>Of terrestrial Mollusca we enumerate the following
Limacidæ&mdash;<i>Arion ater</i>, <i>A. hortensis</i>, <i>Limax marginatus</i>,
<i>L. flavus</i>, <i>L. agrestis</i>, <i>L. arborum</i>, <i>L. maximus</i>, and as
before said one of the Testacellidæ viz., <i>T. Haliotidea</i>.
Among the Helicidæ of course the common kinds are all
present. Of the genus Zonites we have the following
species: <i>Zonites cellarius</i>, <i>Z. glaber</i>, <i>Z. alliarius</i>, and its var.
<i>viridula</i>, <i>Z. nitidulus</i>, <i>Z. purus</i>, and its var. <i>margaritacea</i>,
<i>Z. radiatulus</i>, <i>Z. nitidus</i>, <i>Z. excavatus</i> (one only, at
Knowle), <i>Z. crystallinus</i>. Among the smaller species of
Helix, attention may be called to the following: <i>H. aculeata</i>,
a minute spiny coronet; <i>H. pygmæa</i>, the smallest of
known Helices; <i>Helix fusca</i>, taken in two localities
only, at Knowle and Selly Oak. Of the four species of
Pupa found in Britain, two only occur, <i>Pupa umbilicata</i>
and <i>P. marginata</i>. Of the latter species a colony of the
white variety has been found inhabiting a wall at Cleeve
Prior, Worcestershire. Only two out of our eleven
species of Vertigo have occurred, viz.: <i>Vertigo edentula</i>
and its variety <i>columella</i>, and <i>V. pygmæa</i>. Two Clausiliæ
are found, <i>Clausilia laminata</i> and <i>C. rugosa</i>. It
is somewhat singular that of the four species inhabiting
this country the last named is ubiquitous, while <i>C. Rolphii</i>
and <i>C. biplicata</i> are local. The writer has taken the rare
albino form of <i>C. rugosa</i>, at Selly Oak. That exquisite
shell, <i>Cochlicopa tridens</i>, var. <i>crystallina</i>, has been taken
in three places; the type is largely distributed in our
neighbourhood, whereas in others it is rare, while <i>C.
lubrica</i> is widespread in England. <i>Achatina acicula</i>,
dead shells only, Dudley Castle. <i>Carychium minimum</i>
is commonly distributed.</p>

<p>In giving this outline of the Molluscan Fauna of our
neighbourhood, the writer has called attention to the
valuable papers on Embryology by Professor E. Ray
Lankester, as shedding great light on the affinities of the
Mollusca with other groups.</p>

Insects.</h3>

<p class="author">BY W. G. BLATCH.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Birmingham, and in fact the
Midland district generally, has never been considered
particularly rich in either the number or variety of its
insect productions, and it is a fact that a collection of
Midland species, of whatever order, shows very wide
gaps, both in genera and species, when compared with
one formed in the east or south of England. Nevertheless,
the Midland Counties are not entirely barren in this
respect, and a catalogue of the insects known to occur
within a radius of twenty miles of Birmingham would be
a very respectable one. During the last few years a large
number of very interesting species have been discovered,
and there can be no doubt that with more workers and
greater enthusiasm considerable additions would continue
to be made. By extending the radius somewhat our list
would embrace a good array of species which seem to be
peculiar to the Midlands, such as <i>Bembidium adustum</i>,
<i>Eutheia clavata</i>, <i>Euplectus nubigena</i>, <i>Teredus nitidus</i>,
<i>Macronychus quadrituberculatus</i>, <i>Hylecœtus dermestoides</i>,
<i>Tropideres sepicola</i>, <i>Bagöus diglyptus</i>, <i>Notodonta bicolor</i>,
&amp;c., &amp;c. At any rate these insects have not hitherto
been detected in any other British localities. It is much
to be regretted that local entomology suffers greatly from
two untoward circumstances, viz., the lack of students
and the want of a carefully compiled list of species of the
several orders. The publication of a catalogue of local
insects as far as our present knowledge extends, would
undoubtedly tend to stimulate the intelligent pursuit of
this study, and it seems surprising that such an important
work has not long ago been undertaken by the Natural
History Societies of the district.</p>

<p>Having regard to the limited space allowed for this
paper its object will, perhaps, best be secured by giving
as full a list as possible, of the rarer and more interesting
species belonging to the two most popular orders, viz., the
Coleoptera and the Lepidoptera, together with some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the localities in which they occur. With few exceptions
the references will be to insects which inhabit the twenty
miles radius, a wider range being taken only in specially
interesting cases, but even then it will be impossible to
give anything like an adequate idea of the beetles,
butterflies, and moths of the district.</p>

<p>To prevent the possibility of error it should be stated
that the nomenclature adopted is (for the beetles) that of
the “Catalogue of British Coleoptera, by Matthews and
Fowler, 1883,” and (for the butterflies and moths)
“Synonymic List of British Lepidoptera, by Richard
South, 1884.”</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coleoptera.</span></h4>

<p>This order is well represented; certain localities in the
district are favourable to their existence and economy, and
many rarities occur. Only one Cicindela (<i>Cicindela campestris</i>)
inhabits our district and that is generally distributed
and plentiful, especially in sandy places. The curious and
elegant <i>Cychrus rostratus</i> is often found under stones and
loose bark at Dudley and Bewdley, and the handsome
<i>Carabus nitens</i> and its congener <i>C. arvensis</i>, may be
taken on Cannock Chase, both species being now very
scarce. <i>Elaphrus riparius</i> and <i>E. cupreus</i> occur not
uncommonly in wet and boggy places. <i>Notiophilus
substriatus</i> (generally a sea-side species) may be found
occasionally on Cannock Chase, and so also may the
curious <i>Nebria livida</i>. This latter beetle was first discovered
on the Chase by Mr. J. T. Harris, and the
writer has verified its occurrence there many times. It is a
remarkable fact that this is the only known instance of
this species inhabiting an inland locality&mdash;its head quarters
being at Bridlington Quay and two or three other parts
of the north-east coast&mdash;it lives in the argillaceous cliffs,
and on Cannock Chase it is met with in a similar
formation.</p>

<p>Of the curious genus Dyschirius two species only
appear to have settled in our neighbourhood, viz., <i>D.
æneus</i> and <i>D. globosus</i>, both occur at Bewdley <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>and on
Cannock Chase&mdash;the latter also at Coleshill and Sutton
Park.</p>

<p>The genus Bembidium is well represented, 33 of the 50
British species and varieties being taken in the Birmingham
district. A few may be named: <i>B. rufescens</i>,
under bark and in damp places; <i>B. quinquestriatum</i>, on
walls at Smallheath and Olton; <i>B. Mannerheimii</i>, Knowle,
Bewdley, Cannock Chase; <i>B. articulatum</i>, Knowle,
Bewdley; <i>B. nigricorne</i>, Cannock Chase; <i>B. monticola</i>,
Bewdley; <i>B. Stephensi</i>, Sutton Park; <i>B. prasinum</i>,
Bewdley. In this connection the writer may perhaps be
allowed to refer to the finding by himself of <i>B. adustum</i>
in large numbers at Tewkesbury. This species was
previously represented only by a very few old specimens,
and had not been found for more than 40 years, until he
had the pleasure of re-establishing it.</p>

<p><i>Patrobus assimilis</i> is found sparingly on Cannock Chase;
<i>Trechus discus</i>, <i>T. micros</i> and <i>T. secalis</i>, are plentiful in the
river banks at Bewdley; <i>T. micros</i> occasionally turns up at
Smallheath amongst bones placed in the garden as a trap
for Homalotæ; <i>T. obtusus</i> has occurred at Bewdley and
Cannock Chase, and in the latter locality the writer once
found a few examples of the rare <i>T. rubens</i>.</p>

<p>The important genus Pterostichus has many representatives:
<i>P. versicolor</i>, at Solihull, Sutton Park, and Cannock
Chase; <i>P. lepidus</i>, Cannock Chase; <i>P. picimanus</i> and <i>P.
anthracinus</i>, Bewdley; <i>P. minor</i>, Coleshill and Cannock
Chase; <i>Platyderus ruficollis</i> seems to be generally
distributed, but scarce. <i>Amara fulva</i> may frequently be
taken under stones in sandy places at Sutton Park,
Cannock Chase, and Bewdley; <i>A. consularis</i> at Sutton
Park and Hopwas Wood; <i>A. spinipes</i>, at Dudley and
Bewdley; <i>A. patricia</i>, Cannock Chase; <i>A. acuminata</i>,
Sutton Park; <i>A. lunicollis</i>, Small Heath, Sutton, Cannock
Chase, and Bewdley; <i>A. continua</i>, <i>A. communis</i>, and <i>A.
ovata</i>, at Knowle, Coleshill, and Bewdley.</p>

<p><i>Badister sodalis</i> is to be had at Dudley and Bewdley.
All the species of Calathus occur, and <i>Taphria nivalis</i>, a
closely allied beetle, turns up now and again, singly, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Small Heath, Knowle, Bewdley, and Trench Woods. The
Anchomeni are fairly well represented, and it seems very
likely that additional species may yet be added to our local
list. The following may be selected as most worthy of
notice: <i>Anchomenus oblongus</i>, Bewdley; <i>A. atratus</i>, Coleshill,
Cannock Chase, and Bewdley. A single <i>Lebia chlorocephala</i>
was captured in hedge rubbish near Acock’s Green.
<i>Dromius quadrisignatus</i> is a Sutton Park species, being
found rarely under bark of Oak trees. <i>Blechrus maurus</i>,
which seems decidedly out of its reckoning in a Midland
locality, has been taken at Bewdley and Leamington. All
the species of Metabletus occur, and are pretty generally
distributed. <i>Cymindis vaporariorum</i> inhabits Cannock
Chase, where it may be found lurking under the heather
and loose stones, but is not abundant. In the same
locality the curious <i>Miscodera arctica</i> may, in some seasons,
be met with in plenty. Two species of Chlænius occur,
viz.: <i>C. vestitus</i> at Bewdley, and <i>C. nigricornis</i> at Cannock
Chase. Of the extensive genus Harpalus, the following
species may be cited, it being understood that several of
the commoner forms exist here in great abundance. <i>H.
puncticollis</i>, Dudley and Bewdley; <i>H. griseus</i>, Cannock
Chase; <i>H. tardus</i>, Sutton Park and Bewdley. The pretty
little <i>Acupalpus exiguus</i> and v. <i>luridus</i> may be obtained
by searching the Sphagnum on the margin of Coleshill Pool.
All the Bradycelli, except <i>B. placidus</i> and <i>B. collaris</i>, are
plentiful in the district, and in certain spots, such as
Cannock Chase, they are extremely abundant. <i>Anisodactylus
binotatus</i> occurs on Cannock Chase, but is not often
to be found.</p>

<p>The water beetles are pretty numerously represented
in the district generally, the best localities for them being
Coleshill, Sutton Park, Cannock Chase, and Bewdley.
It must suffice to mention a few of the rarer or more
striking kinds, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Brychius elevatus</i>, at Yardley and
Knowle; <i>Haliplus cinereus</i>, at Knowle; <i>Hydroporus septentrionalis</i>,
Bewdley; <i>H. marginatus</i>, Knowle; <i>H.
picipes</i>, Cannock Chase; <i>H. lepidus</i>, Knowle, Bewdley,
Cannock Chase; <i>H. duodecimpustulatus</i>, Bewdley;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span> <i>H.

Knowle, Bewdley; <i>H. atricapilla</i>, Knowle; the rare
<i>Leptinus testaceus</i> has been taken at Needwood in the
nests of wild bees. <i>Agathidium nigripenne</i> Sutton Park;
<i>A. lævigatum</i>, Knowle, Dudley; <i>A. atrum</i>, Yardley,
Sutton Park, Cannock Chase; <i>A. seminulum</i>, Coleshill,

Wood; <i>Amphicyllis globus</i>, Bewdley; <i>Leoides orbicularis</i>,
Cannock Chase; <i>Anisotoma picea</i>, Cannock Chase; <i>A.
litura</i>, Knowle.</p>

<p>Several of the Burying Beetles&mdash;Necrophorus and
Silpha&mdash;occur generally in the district, as also do many
of the Cholevæ. Colons are conspicuous by their absence&mdash;only
two species having put in an appearance, viz: <i>Colon
dentipes</i>, Knowle; and <i>C. brunneum</i>, Knowle. The interesting
groups of Scydmænidæ and Pselaphidæ are
remarkably well represented, but room can be found for
only a few of the rarer species: <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Scydmænus exilis</i>,
Sutton Park, Hopwas Wood, Cannock Chase, Bewdley;
<i>S. angulatus</i>, Cannock Chase; <i>S. hirticollis</i>, Sutton Park;
<i>Eutheia plicata</i>, Budden Wood, <i>E. Schaumii</i>, Smallheath,
Knowle; <i>E. Scydmænoides</i>, Knowle (abundantly); <i>E.
clavata</i>, new to Britain, discovered by the writer in Sherwood
Forest; <i>Bryaxis impressa</i>, Coleshill; <i>Euplectus
punctatus</i>, Knowle, Bewdley, Cannock Chase;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> <i>E.
nigricans</i>, throughout the district; <i>E. nanus</i>, Edgbaston,
Bewdley, Cannock Chase; <i>E. bicolor</i>, Sutton Park, Hopwas
Wood, Cannock Chase, Bewdley; <i>E. nubigena</i>, a
very distinct species, new to Britain, discovered by the
writer in Sherwood Forest in 1885.</p>

<p>The Brachelytra have not had much attention paid to
them in the Midlands, the group being a very large one,
and the species mostly difficult to determine. These insects
are plentiful in the district and many rare forms occur.
A few only, comparatively, can be here specified:&mdash;<i>Ischnoglossa
corticina</i>, Olton, Sutton Park, Old Hill;
<i>Thiasophila angulata</i>, Hopwas Wood, Bewdley (Ants’
Nests); <i>Dinarda Markelii</i>, Bewdley (in Ants’ Nests);
<i>Atemeles emarginatus</i>, Bewdley (in Ants’ Nests); <i>Ilyobates
nigricollis</i>, <i>Callicerus obscurus</i>, <i>C. rigidicornis</i>, Knowle;
<i>Tachyusa scitula</i>, Bewdley; <i>Ocyusa maura</i>, Coleshill;
<i>O. picina</i>, Sutton Park, Bewdley; <i>Oxypoda exoleta</i>,
Smallheath, <i>O. recondita</i>, Budden Wood (Ants’ Nests,
<i>Formica rufa</i>); <i>O. sericea</i>, new to Britain, Smallheath,
Edgbaston, Knowle.</p>

<p>In the genus Homalota there are 160 British species,
of which the writer has, up to the present, found 93 in the
Birmingham district. The following may be noted:
<i>H. currax</i> and <i>H. insecta</i>, Bewdley; <i>H. pavens</i>, Smallheath;
<i>H. eximia</i>, Bewdley (previously only found on
banks of Scotch rivers); <i>H. luteipes</i>, Bewdley; <i>H. sylvicola</i>,

Knowle; <i>H. gracilicorne</i>, Sutton Park, Hopwas Wood;
<i>H. salicis</i>, Sherwood Forest; <i>Phlœocharis subtilissima</i> and
<i>Prognatha quadricornis</i>, Sutton Park, Needwood.</p>

<p>Many of the Trichopterygidæ are found in profusion,
including a good number of rare species. <i>Ptinella testacea</i>,
<i>P. denticollis</i>, <i>P. aptera</i>, and <i>P. angustula</i>, are all plentiful
in various parts of the district, from Smallheath and
Knowle to Cannock Chase and Bewdley Forest. <i>Pteryx
suturalis</i> is also generally distributed and fairly abundant.
Several good species of Trichopteryx occur in hot-beds at
Knowle and Edgbaston, and also on the river banks at
Bewdley. <i>Millidium trisulcatum</i> sometimes swarms in
one spot at Knowle. <i>Ptenidium Gressneri</i>, a new British
species, may be mentioned as having been captured in
1885 at Sherwood Forest. <i>Triplax russica</i> abounds on
Cannock Chase, and <i>T. ænea</i> may be taken sparingly at
Needwood. The very rare <i>Teredus nitidus</i>, after being
lost sight of for nearly 50 years, was again found in Sherwood
Forest by the writer in 1884 and 1885. <i>Myrmetes piceus</i>,
Hopwas Wood, Bewdley; <i>Gnathoncus rotundatus</i>, Cannock

Salford Priors; <i>Plegaderus dissectus</i>, Cannock Chase,
Salford Priors; <i>Epuræa augustula</i>, Sutton Park; <i>Cryptarcha
strigata</i> and <i>C. imperialis</i>, Knowle; Rhizophagus:
nine of the species occur in the neighbourhood of Birmingham,
and the tenth, <i>R. cœruleipennis</i> has been taken

<i>A. pallens</i>, Solihull, Bewdley; <i>Myrmecoxenus,
vaporariorum</i>, Edgbaston, Knowle; <i>Scaphidium quadrimaculatum</i>
may be taken at Cannock Chase and Bewdley;
<i>Diphyllus lunatus</i>, in the same localities and also near
Knowle; <i>Byrrhus fasciatus</i> and <i>B. dorsalis</i>, at Cannock
Chase; <i>Georyssus pygmæus</i>, Bewdley. The remarkable
beetle, <i>Macronychus quadrituberculatus</i>, should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span> included
in this list, its only British habitat being the river
Dove, near Burton-on-Trent.</p>

<p>Coming now to the Lamellicornia, the following species
may be noted: <i>Lucanus cervus</i>, Bewdley; <i>Dorcus
parallelopipedus</i>, Bewdley, Cannock Chase, Salford Priors;
<i>Aphodius tesselatus</i> and <i>A. porcus</i>, Sutton Park; <i>Ammœcius
brevis</i>, Bewdley (banks of Severn); <i>Trox sabulosus</i>
and <i>T. scaber</i>, Bewdley and Cannock Chase; <i>Hoplia
philanthus</i>, Bewdley, Knowle, &amp;c. Of the Serricornia, a
few examples may be given: <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Agrilus augustatus</i>
and <i>A. laticornis</i>, Bewdley; the brilliant <i>Trachys troglodytes</i>,
quite a Southern species, which the writer has on
several occasions captured in an old pasture at Knowle;
<i>Elater coccinatus</i>, Sherwood; <i>E. pomorum</i>, Cannock
Chase; <i>E. balteatus</i>, Coleshill, Sutton Park, Bewdley,
Cannock Chase; <i>Athöus rhombeus</i>, Sherwood; <i>Corymbites

Knowle, Bewdley, Cannock Chase; <i>Sericosomus brunneus</i>
and v. <i>fugax</i>, Cannock Chase; <i>Hydrocyphon deflexicollis</i>,
Bewdley; <i>Scirtes hemisphæricus</i>, Cannock Chase; <i>Lampyris
noctiluca</i> is spread over the whole district, but is most
abundant in Bewdley Forest; <i>Malachius æneus</i> is found
at Knowle, and <i>Haplocnemus impressus</i> at Sutton Park;
<i>Clerus formicarius</i> occurs at Salford Priors; <i>Hylecœtus
dermestoides</i> and <i>Sphindus dubius</i> at Cannock Chase and
Sherwood Forest; <i>Niptus crenatus</i> and <i>Hedobia imperialis</i>
occur at Knowle.</p>

<p>Of the Longicornia, it must suffice to mention the
following:&mdash;<i>Prionus coriarius</i>, Aston and Cannock Chase;
<i>Callidium alni</i>, Knowle; <i>Clytus mysticus</i>, Bewdley; <i>Pachyta
collaris</i> and <i>P. octomaculata</i>, Bewdley; <i>Strangalia quadrifasciata</i>,
Bewdley and Cannock Chase; <i>S. nigra</i>, Bewdley.</p>

<p>Many of the Donaciæ are plentiful, perhaps the most
interesting local species being <i>D. affinis</i>, which is found
at Knowle.</p>

<p><i>Clythra tridentata</i> and <i>C. quadripunctata</i> inhabit
Bewdley Forest, but <i>C. tridentata</i> is very rarely met with.
<i>Cryptocephalus coryli</i>, <i>C. punctiger</i>, and <i>C. fulcratus</i> may
be beaten out of birches on Cannock Chase, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Chartley the Scotch species, <i>C. decempunctatus</i>, has been
taken.</p>

<p><i>Salpingus ater</i> is at Knowle, and <i>S. castaneus</i> at Coleshill
and Cannock Chase. The curious <i>Notoxus monoceros</i>
is abundant at Kidderminster and Bewdley.</p>

<p>Among the Rhynchophora the following may be noted:
<i>Platyrhinus latirostris</i> and <i>Anthribus albinus</i>, Salford
Priors; <i>Tropideres sepicola</i>, Budden Wood (unique);
<i>Choragus Sheppardi</i>, Salford Priors; <i>Apion Hookeri</i>,
Knowle and Trench Woods; <i>A. filirostre</i>, Trench
Woods; <i>Cænopsis fissirostris</i> and <i>C. Waltoni</i>, Cannock
Chase, also on Hartlebury Common; <i>Cleonus sulcirostris</i>,
Erdington; <i>Cœliodes geranii</i> and <i>C. exiguus</i>, Bewdley;
<i>Amalus scortillum</i>, Bewdley, Salford Priors; <i>Magdalinus
barbicornis</i>, Bewdley; <i>Rhyncolus gracilis</i>, Sherwood
Forest is noteworthy; <i>Phiœophthorus rhododactylus</i>,
Bewdley; <i>Scolytus destructor</i>, Yardley; <i>S. intricatus</i> and
<i>S. rugulosus</i>, Bewdley; <i>Xylocleptes bispinus</i>, Sutton Park
and Malvern.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lepidoptera.</span></h4>

<p>This order has received the lion’s share of attention
from local collectors, with the result that a very fair
proportion of the British Micro-Lepidoptera has been
discovered in the district. The Micro-Lepidoptera have,
however, not been looked up with any enthusiasm, and
consequently our knowledge of the extent to which these
interesting little moths occur about us is extremely
limited.</p>

<p>The Rhopalocera include all the common species, and
also a few which are always considered desirable by every
collector. At Bewdley, <i>Aporia cratægi</i> used to be found,
and doubtless could yet be obtained if carefully sought
for. <i>Leucophasia sinapis</i> flies more or less abundantly
at Bewdley Forest and Trench Woods; it has also been
occasionally taken in woods near Knowle. <i>Colias edusa</i>
always an erratic species, sometimes visits the Midlands,
and has been captured at Yardley, Coleshill, Knowle, and
other places. <i>C. hyale</i> also turned up once or twi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>ce in
the district. <i>Gonopteryx rhamni</i> is generally distributed
and plentiful. <i>Argynnis selene</i>, <i>A. euphrosyne</i>, <i>A. aglaia</i>,
<i>A. adippe</i>, and <i>A. paphia</i> occur near Knowle, and at
Bewdley they are all found in great abundance; the
variety <i>valesina</i> has likewise been captured in the Forest.
<i>Melitæa aurinia</i> is not rare in certain spots near Knowle
and Bewdley. <i>Vanessa C. album</i> may occasionally be
seen flying in the streets of Birmingham, especially in the
region of Sparkbrook and Moseley. <i>V. polychloros</i>
flies at Knowle. <i>V. antiopa</i> has several times been
captured at Bewdley; and <i>V. io</i>, <i>V. atalanta</i>, and <i>V.
cardui</i> are met with throughout the district.</p>

<p>The occurrence of <i>Limenitis sibylla</i> has not been
heard of nearer than Church Stretton, but <i>Apatura iris</i>
has been taken in woods not far from Coventry and
Leamington. <i>Melanargia galatea</i> is a common butterfly
at Salford Priors and Trench Woods. <i>Epinephele
hyperanthes</i> is abundant at Bewdley. The southern
limit of <i>Cænonympha typhon</i> appears to be Chartley
Moss, where the butterfly (both light and dark forms) is
anything but rare. <i>Thecla betulæ</i>, <i>T. W. album</i>, <i>T. pruni</i>,
and <i>T. quercus</i> fly at Trench Woods; <i>T. quercus</i> also
near Knowle, at Bewdley, &amp;c.; and <i>T. rubi</i> is extremely
plentiful at Sutton Park and Cannock Chase. <i>Lycæna
argiolus</i> is found in several localities near Birmingham,
but abounds in the Holly Woods at Sutton Park. <i>L.
semiargus</i> used to be taken many years since, close to
Birmingham, but seems to have become quite extinct.</p>

<p>In the division Heterocera the following list of selected
species with localities must suffice to represent the moths
of the district:&mdash;<i>Acherontia atropos</i>, Knowle, Dudley,
Bewdley; <i>Sphinx convolvuli</i>, Birmingham (frequent);
<i>S. ligustri</i>, Knowle, Sutton, Bewdley; <i>Deilephila galii</i>
and <i>D. livornica</i>, Birmingham (occasional); <i>Chærocampa
celerio</i>, Birmingham (1868); <i>C. nerii</i>, Birmingham (1869);
<i>C. porcellus</i>, Sutton Park; <i>C. elpenor</i>, Solihull, Hockley
Heath; <i>Smerinthus ocellatus</i>, <i>S. populi</i> and <i>S. tiliæ</i> are
found throughout the district. <i>Macroglossa stellatarum</i>

Microscopic Fauna.</h3>

<p class="author">BY THOMAS BOLTON, F.R.M.S.</p>

<p>The writer in drawing up the following summary of the
local Microscopic Fauna, knowing how limited a space
is allowed, has in several of the families given only the
more rare and remarkable species which have come
under his own observation. The organisms included in
this division are abundant all round Birmingham; in
the canals, reservoirs, and rivers, in the swags and
catchpits, amongst the spoil heaps of the “Black Country,”
and in the numerous clay-pits on the farm lands.</p>

<h4>INSECTA.</h4>

<p>It is desirable to call attention to the identification
of the larvæ of the Trichopterous insects <i>Agraylea multipunctata</i>
and <i>Oxyethira costalis</i>, by Messrs. Kenneth J.
Morton and Robert McLachlan. The perfect insects were
bred from larvæ collected in this district, as referred to
in the “Entomologists’ Monthly Magazine,” May and
June, 1886. So many problems in the life history of
insects, having aquatic larvæ, remain unsolved, that it is
desirable that microscopists should pay more attention to
this subject.</p>

<h4>ARACHNIDA.</h4>

<p>The curious Diving-bell Spider, <i>Argyroneta aquatica</i>, is
found in the pools at Sutton Park; and a great variety of
species of the Water-Mites is generally distributed. Mr
W. Saville Kent reports that several specimens received
from this district are new to science.</p>

<p>Tardigrada, viz., <i>Macrobiotus Hufelandii</i>, and other
species, may be found almost everywhere, if carefully
looked for amongst damp moss and decaying algæ.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>
<h4>CRUSTACEA.</h4>

<p>In this class should be mentioned the freshwater
Crayfish, <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>, not of course a microscopic
organism; but if it were omitted here it would not appear
in any of the other reports. This species is fairly distributed
in most of the smaller brooks, in the canals, and
larger reservoirs, but is not so abundant or so large as it
is on the lime formations round Oxford. Two other large
microscopic species of this class, the freshwater Shrimp,
<i>Gammarus pulex</i>, and the water Wood-louse, <i>Asellus
vulgaris</i>, are always present, the former busy in its office
of scavenger in the sandy bottoms of the brooks and
ditches, and the latter climbing about, like a monkey,
amongst the water weeds, investigating the mass of living
and decaying organisms with which the weeds are
clothed.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Entomostraca.</span></h5>

<p>The members of this sub-class are also to be found
everywhere, but it is desirable to call special attention to
the discovery for the first time in Great Britain of the
wonderfully transparent <i>Leptodora hyalina</i>, at a visit of
the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical
Society in 1879, to the Olton Reservoir, near Solihull.
It has since been found in many localities, and is very
abundant in the summer and autumn in the Warwick
Canal and several reservoirs. <i>Hyalodaphnia Kahlbergensis</i>
is very generally found with it. <i>Argulus coregoni</i>
is found in the Birmingham and Warwick Canal. It had
only been discovered in Great Britain previously in the
tanks of the Royal Aquarium at Westminster, which, of
course, are not used for British fish exclusively. The Fairy-shrimp,
<i>Chirocephalus diaphanus</i>, is found in only one
locality in the district, near Knowle. A few specimens
of the very rare <i>Lynceus acanthocercoides</i> were found
near Bewdley, and amongst other local finds may be
mentioned <i>Moina rectirostris</i>, <i>Macrothrix roseus</i>, and
<i>Ilyocryptus sordidus</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>
<h4>POLYZOA.</h4>

<p>These are generally distributed; <i>Alcyonella fungosa</i>,
<i>Plumatella repens</i>, <i>Fredericella sultana</i>, and <i>Paludicella
Ehrenbergii</i> cover the root-fibres under the banks of
the River Avon, at Evesham. <i>Lophopus crystallinus</i> is
occasionally found in the brooks to the south west of
Birmingham. <i>Cristatella mucedo</i> is often very abundant
in the larger reservoirs at Sutton Park, Barnt Green,
Olton, &amp;c. Fredericella and Paludicella, have several
times been seen in the town water supplied by the
Corporation.</p>

<h4>ROTIFERA.</h4>

<p>The district appears to be very rich in these organisms,
and a good number of new species from this locality are
enumerated in the admirable Monograph on this family
now being published by Dr. C. T. Hudson and Mr. P.
H. Gosse. In the five parts already published (July 12th,
1886), they record one hundred and ninety-two species,
of which ninety-eight have been found in this district,
twenty-two being new species. Of the fifteen Flosculariæ
eight species have been found here, viz., <i>Flosculariæ
regalis</i> (new), <i>F. coronetta</i>, <i>F. ornata</i>, <i>F. cornuta</i>, <i>F.
campanulata</i>, <i>F. ambigua</i>, <i>F. calva</i>, and <i>F. mutabilis</i>
(new). <i>Stephanoceros Eichhornii</i> may sometimes be seen
quite clothing the water weeds in the canals and
pools. The always attractive building Wheel-animalcule,
<i>Melicerta ringens</i>, is occasionally present in abundance in
the canals, rivers, and pools all over the district. The
writer has taken <i>Melicerta conifera</i> several times. <i>Melicerta
tubicolaria</i> was found by Dr. Hudson in Sutton Park,
and has since been found in other localities in this
district. <i>Limnias ceratophylli</i> is very generally abundant.
<i>Limnias annulatus</i> has been found in two places.
<i>Œcistes cystallinus</i> is common, and <i>Œ. intermedius</i> not
uncommon. Although beyond the radius, it may be
interesting to note that <i>Melicerta Janus</i>, new to England,
was taken in one of the Shropshire meres, by the
writer on the 23rd of June, 1886. It had only been
found in Scotland before, by Mr. Hood, in 1880.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
The new rotifer, <i>Œcistes umbella</i>, was found by Mr.
A. W. Wills, together with the rare <i>Œ. pilula</i> in a
pool at Sutton Park. The charming clustered rotifer,
<i>Lacinularia socialis</i>, only appears in the hot summer
months, but was surprisingly abundant last year in the
River Avon at Warwick, literally clothing the weeds with
life. This rotifer was in fair abundance a few years back
in the Barnt Green Reservoir, and last year in the
neighbouring canal. The still more charming free-swimming
clustered rotifer, <i>Conochilus volvox</i>, is more
generally present, but is not always easy to detect, on
account of its transparency and continuous quick movements.
The writer has taken this rotifer in the pools at
Sutton Park with a muslin net in such abundance as to
form quite a jelly at the bottom of the net. He also found a
new species, <i>Conochilus dossuarius</i>, in 1884. Of the
Philodinidæ, the following have been found&mdash;<i>Philodina
roseola</i>, <i>P. citrina</i>, <i>P. megalotrocha</i>, <i>P. aculeata</i>; <i>Rotifer
vulgaris</i>, <i>R. tardus</i>, <i>R. macroceros</i>, <i>R. macrurus</i>;
<i>Actinurus Neptunius</i>, <i>Callidina elegans</i>, and <i>Adineta vaga</i>.
The rare and pretty little <i>Microdon clavus</i> may be found
swimming about in Coleshill pool. Asplanchna, Synchæta,
Polyarthra, and Triarthra, may be netted in enormous
numbers in the summer months, especially in all the
canals and larger pools, and they occasionally abound in
the smaller pools and even in ditches, together with a
great variety of the creeping ones, such as Philodina,
Rotifer, Notommata, Brachionus, Anuræa, &amp;c. The
wonderful variety of these living together in a small ditch
in Sutton Park is reported upon in a short paper read by
the writer before the Birmingham Natural History and
Microscopical Society in February last, and published in
the “Midland Naturalist,” July, 1886. <i>Hydatina senta</i>
and <i>Rhinops vitrea</i> may be looked for amongst the
<i>Euglena viridis</i> often seen luxuriating in farm yard
drainage. The abnormal species, <i>Pedalion mira</i>, was
found at Knowle in 1884, in fair abundance. The spiny
<i>Anuræa longispina</i> was found at Olton Reservoir very soon
after it was first discovered in America, and it soon afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>s
abounded in the town water, and may be found in
most large reservoirs.</p>

<h4>ANNELIDA, ETC.</h4>

<p>Some interesting examples of the Oligochæta have
been found in this locality, most of which have been identified
by Professor E. Ray Lankester or Mr. E. C. Bousfield,
and of these the following are noteworthy&mdash;<i>Chætogaster
limnæi</i>, and <i>C. diaphanus</i>, <i>Nais hamata</i>, <i>N. lurida</i>, <i>N.
appendiculata</i>, and <i>N. barbata</i>; <i>Stylaria parasitica</i>, <i>Dero
digitata</i>, <i>D. obtusa</i>, <i>D. Perrieri</i>, <i>D. limosa</i>, and <i>D. crassa</i>;
<i>Salvina serpentina</i>, and <i>Ælosoma quaternarium</i>. The Cercaria
(the larva of a fluke) which infests the common Water
Snail, <i>Limnæa stagnatis</i>, is occasionally found; also
<i>Mesostomum rostratum</i>, <i>Derostomum vorax</i>, <i>Planaria lactea</i>,
and <i>Piscicola geometrica</i>.</p>

<h4>HYDROZOA.</h4>

<p>Both <i>Hydra vulgaris</i> and <i>H. viridis</i> are of course found
everywhere. <i>Cordylophora lacustris</i>, which is usually more
abundant in brackish water, was found last year in the
canal at Hamstead, near Handsworth. The writer has
found it in the Stourbridge canal, and in the River Stour.
Some years back the writer heard of a canal boat being
docked at Dudley Port which was found to be clothed
with this Hydrozoon as with velvet.</p>

<h4>SPONGIDA.</h4>

<p>The freshwater sponges, <i>Spongilla fluviatilis</i> and <i>S.
lacustris</i>, are abundant, but no one has taken up the
subject in this district, to work out the different species
into which this genus is now divided.</p>

<h4>INFUSORIA.</h4>

<p>When Mr. W. Saville Kent was preparing his manual
on this subject, he was supplied with a great variety
of specimens from this district, many of which proved to
be new ones. The following are worthy of mention:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
<i>Anthophysa vegetans</i>, <i>Rhipidodendron Huxleyi</i>, <i>Spongomonas
intestinalis</i>; various <i>Codosigæ</i> and other Choano-flagellate
monads, including <i>Salpingœca Boltoni</i>, Kent, (new);
<i>Euglena acus</i>; <i>Dinobryon sertularia</i>; <i>Synura uvella</i>; <i>Uroglena
volvox</i> (very general); <i>Distigma proteus</i>; <i>Hemidinium
nasutum</i>; <i>Peridinium tabulatum</i>; <i>Ceratium longicorne</i>;
<i>Nassula ornata</i>; <i>Trachelius ovum</i>; <i>Spirostomum teres</i>, and
<i>S. ambiguum</i>; <i>Stentor polymorphus</i>, <i>S. Barretti</i>, <i>S. cœruleus</i>,
and <i>S. niger</i>; <i>Folliculina Boltoni</i>, Kent (new.) The
writer has found several free swimming Tintinnus, not
corresponding with any that Mr. W. Saville Kent enumerates;
<i>Didinium nasutum</i>; <i>Trichodina pediculus</i>; <i>Scyphidium
Fromentellii</i>; <i>Spirochona gemmipara</i>; <i>Vorticella
chlorostigma</i>, and <i>V. monilata</i>; <i>Carchesium polypinum</i>,
and <i>C. epistylidis</i>; <i>Zoothamnium arbuscula</i>; <i>Vaginicola
tincta</i>; <i>Thuricola folliculata</i>; <i>Cothurnia imberbis</i>; <i>Ophrydium
versatile</i>, <i>O. Eichhornii</i>, and <i>O. sessile</i>; <i>Stichotricha
remex</i>; <i>Atineta lemnarum</i>, <i>A. grandis</i>, and <i>A. mystacina</i>;
<i>Dendrosoma radians</i>.</p>

<h4>RHIZOPODA.</h4>

<p>The following have been found: <i>Amœba proteus</i>,
<i>A. verrucosa</i>, <i>A. radiosa</i>, and <i>A. villosa</i>; <i>Ouramœba
vorax</i>; <i>Lithamœba vorax</i>, Lankester (new); <i>Difflugia
pyriformis</i>, <i>D. spiralis</i>, and <i>D. corona</i>; <i>Cyphoderia umbella</i>;
<i>Arcella vulgaris</i>; <i>Actinophrys sol</i>; <i>Raphidiophrys pallida</i>,
and <i>R. elegans</i>; <i>Actinosphærium Eichhornii</i>; <i>Acanthocystis
chætophora</i>; <i>Archerina Boltoni</i>, Lankester (new); <i>Clathrulina
elegans</i>, and <i>Biomyxa vagans</i>.</p>

BOTANY.</h2>

<h3><a name="Introductory" id="Introductory"></a><span class="smcap">Introductory Remarks.</span></h3>

<p class="author">BY WM. MATHEWS, M.A.</p>

<p>In attempting to describe the more interesting features
of the indigenous Flora of the neighbourhood of Birmingham,
it is necessary to define the limits of the district
intended to be included. A circle of 20 miles radius,
with the Town Hall as its centre, has been found
convenient as an approximate boundary. This will enclose
portions of the three counties of Warwick, Worcester,
and Stafford, which meet at a point on the south-western
edge of the Borough, and a small part of the County of
Salop. The latter, with the exception shortly to be
mentioned, will be excluded from consideration. On the
other hand, the radius must be extended about two miles
on the south-east to take in the town of Stratford-on-Avon,
and about the same distance on the west to take in the
woodlands west of the Severn from Shrawley Wood to
Wyre Forest near Bewdley. A part of the Forest is in
Salop, and to this extent only is the latter county admitted.
The district thus defined contains an area of about 12,500
square miles. It includes the towns of Birmingham,
Sutton Coldfield, Tamworth, Nuneaton, Coventry, Leamington,
Warwick, Stratford, and Alcester, in the County
of Warwick; of Bromsgrove, Droitwich, Stourport,
Bewdley, Kidderminster, Stourbridge, Halesowen, and
Dudley, in Worcester; of Wolverhampton, Walsall, Penkridge,
Cannock, Rugeley, and Lichfield, in Stafford.</p>

<p>The vegetation of any district depends partly on the
nature of the soil, as determined by its geological
structure, partly on altitude and drainage areas, and
partly on the character of the surface, whether water,
bog, heath, arable, pasture or woodland. The geology
has been treated of in a previous part of this volume.
It will be sufficient to say here that the red rocks of the
Trias occupy by far the largest portion of the area, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
that calcareous soils are rare. An elevated line of country,
commencing north of Wolverhampton, runs in a southerly
direction, by Sedgley, Dudley, and the Rowley Hills, to
Frankley Beeches and the Upper Lickey, where it attains
an altitude of about 900 feet above the sea. This is the
great water parting of central England which divides the
drainage areas of the Trent and Severn. From the
Lickey, a line of lower elevation runs in a westerly
direction and divides the tributaries of the Trent from
those of the Avon. The subordinate river basins and
surface characteristics will be noticed in the special
articles.</p>

<p>A brief outline of the history of the Botany of the
Midland Counties may be useful to students, and is
therefore included in these remarks. It commences with
the honoured name of William Withering, one of the
most eminent of British Botanists. Born at Wellington, in
Shropshire, in 1741, he practised as a physician in
Birmingham, where he died in 1799. The first edition of
his well-known “Botanical arrangement of British Plants,”
in two volumes, was published in 1776; the second, in
three vols. in 1787; the third, in four vols. in 1796. It
passed through five further editions, in four volumes, after
his death. Numerous references to localities in the
neighbourhood of Birmingham are contained in these
volumes.</p>

<p>Scarcely less distinguished was Thomas Purton (1768-1833),
surgeon, of Alcester, the author of “The Midland
Flora.” The first two volumes of the work appeared in
1817, the third in 1821. They contain copious descriptions
of local habitats in the counties of Warwick,
Worcester, and Stafford.</p>

<p>Nash’s “History of Worcestershire,” 1781, contains
(Introduction p. lxxxix.) a list of forty-three rare plants,
two only of which, <i>Vaccinium Oxycoccos</i> and <i>Comarum
palustre</i>, recorded as growing at the Lickey, belong to
the Birmingham district. The Supplement (1799) has a
further list of forty-seven plants, four of which belong to
the district.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>
<p>The late W. G. Perry, bookseller, of Warwick, published
at Warwick, in 1820, the first Flora of that county, under
the title of “Plantæ Varvicenses Selectæ.” He also
contributed to the Magazine of Natural History, Vol. iv.,
p. 450, 1831, a list of some of the rarer plants of
Worcestershire, chiefly from the neighbourhood of Kidderminster
and Bewdley.</p>

<p>The “History of Stourbridge,” by William Scott,
Stourbridge, 1832, contains a list of plants from the
neighbourhood of that town, in the counties of Worcester
and Stafford.</p>

<p>For a knowledge of the plants of the immediate vicinity
of Birmingham, and particularly of the once celebrated
“Moseley Wake Green,” Botanists are chiefly indebted
to the late William Ick, Secretary of the old Philosophical
Society of Birmingham. Mr. Ick published two lists; the
first in “The Analyst,” for 1837, Vol. vi., p. 20; the
second in the “Midland Counties Herald,” Aug. 1838.</p>

<p>The present Mrs. Avery, then Miss M. A. Beilby, was
a frequent visitor to Moseley at about that date, and has
obliged the writer with a list of the rarities gathered by
her at Moseley Bog and Common in 1835 and 1836.</p>

<p>A list of some of the rarer plants of the neighbourhood
of Birmingham, by Saml. Freeman, appeared in the first
series of the Phytologist, Vol. i., p. 261.</p>

<p>The Rev. W. T. Bree, Rector of Allesley, near Coventry,
was a well-known Botanist. He contributed to Purton’s
Midland Flora, to the Magazine of Natural History, and
to the first series of the Phytologist, many notices of
the plants of the northern part of his county.</p>

<p>The first volume of the last named serial, 1844, pp.
508-514, contains an account of the ferns of Stafford,
Warwick, and Worcester, from the pen of the Editor, the
late Edward Newman.</p>

<p>The second series of the Phytologist, 1855 to 1863,
was edited by the late Alexander Irvine of Chelsea.
Several plants from the neighbourhood of Clent and
Churchill are recorded by the Editor, in an article on the
“Botany of the Clent Hills,” Vol. ii., p. 385, April, 1858.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>
<p>The Studies of Warwickshire Fungi, made by the late
Mrs. F. Russell, of Kenilworth, will be noticed in the
article on that group of plants.</p>

<p>The County Botany of Worcester has been associated
for upwards of half a century, with the name of the veteran
Worcester Botanist, Mr. Edwin Lees. His first observations,
made in conjunction with the late Dr. Streeten, were
published in Hastings’s “Illustrations of the Natural
History of Worcestershire,” (1834). These, together with
a further list supplied by him to the late H. C. Watson,
are incorporated in the Catalogue of Worcestershire plants
in “The New Botanists’ Guide,” (1835). The same work
contains lists of the plants of Warwick and Stafford. In
1867, Mr. Lees published his “Botany of Worcester,” the
only complete record of the flowering plants and ferns of
the whole county, which has yet appeared. His “Botany
of the Malvern Hills,” which has passed through three
editions, relates to a part of the county outside the limits
of the Birmingham district.</p>

<p>The plants of the north-east of the county are enumerated
in the “Flora of the Clent and Lickey Hills,” by the
present writer. First edition, 1868; Second Edition,
1881. He has been indebted for assistance to many
friends, too numerous to mention in this notice.</p>

<p>“The Natural History of Stafford,” by R. Garner, 1884,
contains a list of the rarer plants of that county. Our
more recent knowledge of its botany is due to Dr. Fraser,
of Wolverhampton, whose discoveries are published in
the Reports of the Botanical Record Club, 1873-1883.
These reports contain also many district records communicated
by the Editor, Dr. F. Arnold Lees, and by
Mr. J. E. Bagnall.</p>

<p>The modern geographical botany of Warwick is the
work of members of the Birmingham Natural History and
Microscopal Society, and especially of Mr. J. E. Bagnall,
Mr. A. W. Wills, and Mr. W. B. Grove. The volumes of
“The Midland Naturalist” have been enriched by
numerous papers from these Botanists, for one of which, the
monograph on the Pilobolidæ, published in Vol. vii.,
1884, the Darwin Gold Medal of the Midland Union
of Natural History Societies was awarded to Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>Grove.
Those relating to the Botany of the county are, by
Mr. Bagnall, “The Distribution of the Roses,” (Vol. i,
1878), “The Moss Flora,” (Vols. ii. and iii., 1879-80),
“The Hepaticæ,” (Vol. iii., 1880), and “The Flora
of Warwickshire,” (Vols. iv.-ix., 1880-86); by Mr. Wills,
“The Desmidiæ of Sutton Park,” (Vol. iii., 1880); by
Mr. Grove, “The Fungi of the neighbourhood of
Birmingham,” (Vols. v.-vii., 1882-84.)</p>

<p>The works of the late Hewett Cottrell Watson, the founder
of the Science of the Geographical Botany of Great Britain,
must not be passed over. Those containing provincial
or comital records, besides the new Botanists’ Guide
already mentioned, are the Cybele Britannica, 1847-1872;
Topographical Botany, 1st edit., 1873-4, 2nd edit., 1883.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to mention that a Students’
Garden for economic and medicinal plants was laid out
in 1882, in the Edgbaston Botanical Gardens, from the
plans of Professor Hillhouse, of Mason College, and that
a Students’ garden of British plants has been laid out, in
the present year, in Cannon Hill Park, from the plans of
Mr. J. W. Oliver, teacher of Botany at the Midland
Institute. For the establishment of the latter garden,
students are indebted to Mr. Alderman White, chairman
of the Baths and Parks Committee of the Town Council.</p>

<p>County boundaries have been so generally adopted as
the limits of local Floras, that it has been thought desirable
to adhere to them, and to tabulate the plants separately
for Warwick, Worcester, and Stafford, whenever the
materials at command have admitted of this division.
The flowering plants and ferns present no difficulty, but
with respect to the lower forms of vegetation it has not
always been found possible to determine their comital
distribution. The plants indigenous to the district are
described in the following articles:&mdash;</p>

The Flowering Plants, Ferns, &amp;c.</h3>

<p class="author">BY J. E. BAGNALL, A.L.S.</p>

<p>The flowering plants, ferns, and fern allies of the
Birmingham District will be described, as stated in the
Introductory Remarks, under the heads of the three
counties of Warwick, Worcester, and Stafford. The total
flora of the district comprises upwards of 1,116
flowering plants and ferns; of these 844 are native,
143 are varieties, 14 aliens, 42 colonists, and 73 are
denizens. The nomenclature adopted is that of the 7th
edition of the “London Catalogue of British Plants.”</p>

<h4>WARWICK.</h4>

<p>The Warwickshire portion of the district comprises
the greater part of North Warwickshire, with a portion
of South Warwickshire. It is watered by the Tame,
with its affluents the Rea, Cole, Blythe, Bourne, and
Anker; and the Avon with its affluents the Leam,
Sow, Alne, and Arrow. The greatest elevations occur at
Hartshill, Dosthill, Corley, Alne Hills, and Arrow, none
of which exceed 550 feet above the sea. As a whole it
is well wooded, but the woods are usually small and not
productive of the rarer woodland species. Heath lands
are mostly reclaimed, and the more extensive marshes
and bogs drained, hence ericetal and bog plants are rare.
It has been divided into the following sub-districts,
bounded by the water partings of the river basins:&mdash;I.
<span class="smcap">Tame</span>, II. <span class="smcap">Blythe</span>, III. <span class="smcap">Anker</span>, IV. <span class="smcap">Avon</span>, V. <span class="smcap">Sow</span>,
VI. <span class="smcap">Alne</span>, VII. <span class="smcap">Arrow</span>.</p>

<p>In presenting an account of the rarer plants as full
a list from each sub-district (as space permits) will be
given, but many of the plants cited for one or other sub-district
may also be found in one or more of the others.</p>

<p>The plants marked by an asterisk* before the name
are probably extinct.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>
<p>I. <span class="smcap">Tame.</span>&mdash;This sub-district embraces all those portions
of the Tame valley not drained by the Blythe or
Anker, and includes Sutton, Middleton, Water Orton,
Kingsbury, Shustoke, and Arley. The country is generally
flat, but is slightly elevated on both right and left banks,
near Arley, Middleton, Dosthill, and Shustoke. In this
district about 750 flowering plants and ferns are recorded;
among the more rare are&mdash;</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Blythe.</span>&mdash;The Blythe, which rises on the borders
of East Worcestershire near Earlswood, takes its course
through Solihull, Knowle, Hampton-in-Arden, Packington,
and Coleshill, to its confluence with the Tame, near
Whitacre; with this is included the Cole, running through
Marston Green and Coleshill. This sub-district is mostly
flat, the soils are usually sand, marl, and clay. Heath
lands occur near Earlswood and Coleshill; bogs and
marshes near Coleshill and Barston. The recorded flora
is about 820 flowering plants and ferns, the following
being the more noteworthy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Thalictrum flavum; Aquilegia vulgaris; Drosera rotundifolia;
Cerastium arvense; Sagina ciliata; *Elatine hexandra; Hypericum

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Anker.</span>&mdash;The Anker rises about 3 miles S.E. of
Bedworth, drains the country about Bedworth, Nuneaton,
Atherstone, Polesworth and Tamworth, and enters
the Tame at Tamworth. The country it waters is
usually flat, but on its left bank at Hartshill and Polesworth
there is rising ground about 500 feet above sea
level. In this sub-district the Warwickshire coalfields
occur, and it is possibly due to the great prevalence of
smoke that its flora is meagre and the plants often depauperated.
The recorded flora is about 680 flowering
plants and ferns, and among the more rare are:</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>*Myosurus minimus; Cardamine amara, C. impatiens; Viola

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Avon.</span>&mdash;This sub-district includes that portion of
South Warwick within the area not drained by the Leam,
Sow, Alne, and Arrow, including Milverton, Stoneleigh,
Warwick, Stratford-on-Avon, Bidford and Salford Priors.
This valley is beautifully undulating and well-wooded,
watered by many minor streams, with very varied soils and
usually highly cultivated. Its flora is peculiar from the
absence of bog and heath plants, the records comprising
about 970 flowering plants and ferns, of which the following
are the rarer:&mdash;</p>

tributaries, draining Combe fields, Brinklow and Sow Waste
on the east, and Allesley, Corley, and Kenilworth on the
west. The high land about Corley divides the watersheds
of the Tame and Avon. The flora of this sub-district is
about 691 flowering plants and ferns, the more noteworthy
being&mdash;</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Alne.</span>&mdash;The Alne, rises near Tanworth on the west
border of Warwickshire, the high land there forming in
part the watershed of the Avon and Tame. Its course is
through Henley-in-Arden, near here it is joined by an
important tributary draining the country between Henley,
Lapworth, and Rowington. This sub-district is somewhat
hilly, the Alne Hills being the highest elevations.
It includes Tanworth, Henley-in-Arden, Bearley, Alne,
Wilmcote, Claverdon, Hatton, Rowington. The Lias
soils prevail in southern part of the district. The flora is
about 745 flowering plants and ferns, the following being
the more rare&mdash;</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Clematis vitalba; Ranunculus Drouetii; Helianthemum vulgare;
Viola hirta; Geranium pratense, G. pusillum; Melilotus officinalis;

<p>VII. <span class="smcap">Arrow.</span>&mdash;The Arrow enters the county near
Redditch, and takes its course through a narrow hilly
valley to its confluence with the Avon at Salford Priors,
passing on its way Studley, Alcester, Arrow, Wixford, and
Broome. This sub-district is well wooded; the soils are
mostly Keuper marls and sand, with Lias soils prevailing
about Wixford. The flora has not been fully worked out,
but the record is now about 706 flowering plants and
ferns; among the more noteworthy are:&mdash;</p>

<h4>WORCESTER.</h4>

<p>The Worcestershire portion of the district extends
from Oldbury and Yardley in the north, to Abbot’s
Morton on the south. It is watered by the Cole
and Rea, tributaries to the Tame, by the Stour and
Salwarp, tributaries to the Severn, by the Severn itself,
and by the Arrow and minor streams tributaries to the
Avon. A range of hills about eight miles long runs
across the country from north-west to south-east, and
articulates with the central water parting at Bromsgrove
Lickey. It includes Clent, Walton and Romsley Hills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Frankley Beeches, the Upper and the Lower Lickey, and
rises in Walton Hill, to a maximum height of 1036 feet
above the sea. The Worcestershire portion of the district
has been divided into the following eight sub-districts,
distinguished by the Roman numerals I. to VIII. It has
not been found convenient in every case to adopt water
partings as sub-divisional boundaries.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Rea.</span> II. <span class="smcap">Clent and Lickey.</span> III. <span class="smcap">Stour.</span>

by the Rea and Cole. Surface strata, red marl, occasionally
covered by modern drift.</p>

<p>The flora of this sub-district has, unhappily, mainly an
historical interest. Moseley Wake Green and Bog,
drained and enclosed in or about 1840, and now partly
built upon, formerly produced the following rarities:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Elatine hexandra</i> and <i>Hydropiper</i>, reported by the
late Mr. Alexander Irvine in a “Mill Pond near Churchill
station,” in 1857, have not been seen by any other
botanist.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">East Severn.</span>&mdash;Country from the west bank of
the Stour to the east bank of the Severn near Bewdley
and Stourport, including Hartlebury Common east of
Severn, below the junction of the Stour at Stourport.

<p>V. <span class="smcap">West Severn.</span>&mdash;Country west of the Severn, from
Wyre Forest on the north, to Shrawley Wood on the
south. Surface strata: Waterstones, soft red Bunter,
Permian breccia, Coal measures, Old red sandstone. This
sub-district extends somewhat beyond the twenty miles
radius. It is chiefly remarkable for the large area of
woodland known as Wyre Forest, which produces a
number of rarities not found elsewhere within the County.
Part of the forest is in Salop. The following list includes
plants from both counties:&mdash;</p>

Wyre Forest, and reputed the only wild one in Britain,
was destroyed by fire in 1862. <i>Spiranthes æstioalis</i>
has once been gathered in the great bog in the Forest;
<i>Coronilla varia</i> occurs as a casual on the right bank of the
Severn, about a mile above Bewdley.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Arrow.</span>&mdash;Country between Barnt Green and
Redditch, surrounding the village of Alvechurch. With the

<p>VII. <span class="smcap">Salwarp.</span>&mdash;Country from the S.W. foot of the
Lickey Hills, to the Salwarp below Droitwich. Surface
strata: Red Marl, Waterstones. The most noticeable
features are the extensive tract of woodland known as the
Randans, and the Salt Works of Stoke and Droitwich.
The latter have rendered the canals and streams in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>the

<p>VIII. <span class="smcap">Avon.</span>&mdash;The country about Feckenham on the
streams tributary to the Avon, is situated partly on the
Lias, and partly on the Red Marl. It is the only one of
the eight sub-districts in which the Lias occurs. The following
plants are principally characteristic of the calcareous
soil of the Lias&mdash;</p>

are all extinct.</p>

<h4>STAFFORD.</h4>

<p>The Staffordshire portion of the district extends from
Upper Arley, on the west to Penkridge and Rugeley on
the north, and to Tamworth on the east. The parish o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>f
Dudley, which, although in Worcester is entirely surrounded
by Stafford, will be treated as part of the latter
county. The principal elevations are the Silurian Hills
of Dudley Castle, 550 feet, and of the Wren’s Nest, 500
feet above the sea, situated on the central water parting.
West of these are Kinver Edge, 550 feet, and on the east
Barr Beacon, 654 feet. It is watered on the west by the
Severn, on the north and east by the Trent and Tame,
and other tributary streams. It produces on the whole
an interesting flora, notwithstanding the fact that the South
Staffordshire Coalfield with the collieries and iron works,
so destructive to vegetation, is included within its limits.
The sub-districts adopted are: I. <span class="smcap">Severn</span>, II. <span class="smcap">Trent</span>,
III. <span class="smcap">Tame</span>.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Severn.</span>&mdash;This sub-district comprises Upper Arley,

and N.E. of Wolverhampton, including Codsall, Penkridge,
Cannock Chase, Rugeley, Abbotts Bromley and
Alrewas. Much of this sub-district has a sub-Alpine
character in its physical features and flora, and is beautifully
undulated throughout. The rocks are mainly Triassic,

The Mosses, Hepatics, and Lichens.</h3>

<p class="author">BY J. E. BAGNALL, A.L.S.</p>

<p>In describing the rarer Mosses, Hepatics and Lichens,
to be found within the district, the materials at command
are not sufficient to admit of so minute an analysis of distribution
as that given for the flowering plants in the
preceding pages. For the mosses four sub-districts will
be adopted: I. <span class="smcap">Warwick, Tame</span>; II. <span class="smcap">Warwick, Avon</span>;
III. <span class="smcap">Worcester</span>; IV. <span class="smcap">Stafford</span>. For the Hepatics and
Lichens, the enumeration will be restricted to Warwick
only; information for Worcester and Stafford not being
within reach. The nomenclature of the Mosses and
Hepatics is that of the “London Catalogue of British
Mosses and Hepatics,” 2nd Edit., 1881. The nomenclature
of the Lichens is that of “The Lichen Flora,” of
the Revd. W. A. Leighton, 1871.</p>

<h4>MOSSES.</h4>

<p>The Moss Flora of the whole district under review, so
far as records are available, is about 272 species and
varieties; that of Warwickshire alone being about 261.
Its comparative poverty may be attributed, partly to the
absence of great elevations, partly to the prevalence of
smoke over large portions of the district, and partly to the
draining of bogs and marshes, and reclamation of heath
lands.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Warwick, Tame.</span>&mdash;This sub-district includes that
portion of the country watered by the Tame and its
affluents, the Cole, Blythe, Bourne, and Anker. The following
are the more noticeable mosses.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Sphagnum fimbriatum, S. squarrosum, S. rubellum, S. papillosum,

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Warwick, Avon.</span>&mdash;This sub-district includes that
portion of Avon within the area, and its affluents, the Sow,
Alne, and Arrow. The following are the more rare
mosses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Worcester.</span>&mdash;The moss flora of this sub-district
has not been published; but the moss herbaria of Mr.
Mathews and the writer afford records of about 127 species.
Many of these have already been recorded for Warwick,
and are therefore omitted here. The following, which are
mainly from the Stour sub-district, are the more noteworthy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Sphagnum auriculatum; S. cuspidatum, S. intermedium;
Dicranum scoparium; Leucobryum glaucum; Pleuridium nitidum;

lucens; Climacium dendroides; Brachythecium populeum;
Rhynchostegium murale; Hypnum commutatum, H. palustre, H.
chrysophyllum; *H. scorpioides.</p></div>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Stafford.</span>&mdash;The record given in Garner’s Natural
History of Staffordshire, of the mosses of that county,
refers to localities which are all outside the area. Hence
it is impossible to do more than mention the rarer species
collected by myself, mostly within a ten mile radius of
Birmingham, and a few additional records supplied by
Dr. Fraser. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Dicranella cerviculata, D. rufescens, D. crispa; Dicranum
Scoparium, D. palustre, D. majus; Pleuridium nitidum; Tortula
Hornschuchiana, T. ambigua, T. aloides; Didymodon rubellus;

B. albicans; Eurhynchium murale, E. Teesdalii; Plagiothecium
elegans, P. undulatum; Hypnum intermedium, H. chrysophyllum,
H. vernicosum, H. giganteum.</p></div>

<h4>HEPATICÆ.</h4>

<p>The Hepaticæ and Lichens are poorly represented, and
as no available record of these plants occurs, only those
of the Warwickshire portion of the district will be given.</p>

<p>Of the Hepaticæ only about 41 species have as yet been
found, the more noteworthy being:&mdash;</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Fossombronia pusilla; Madotheca platyphylla; Radula complanata;
Scapania nemorosa, S. irrigua; Plagiochila nemorosa; Aplozia
crenulata, A. sphærocarpa; Gymnocolea inflata; Jungermannia ventricosa;
Cephalozia byssacea, C. Starkii, *C. curvifolia, C. connivens;
Trichocolea tomentella; Metzgeria furcata; Aneura multifida, A.
sinuata, A. pinguis; Lunularia cruciata; Conocephalus conicus;
Anthoceros punctatus, A. lævis; Riccia glauca; Ricciella fluitans.</p></div>

<h4>LICHENS.</h4>

<p>So far as experience serves the Lichen flora of the
district appears to be very limited. From Worcestershire
I have seen no records except that probably exhaustive
one by Mr. Edwin Lees in his “Botany and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Geology of Malvern,” where we find about 240 species
recorded for the Malvern district, but outside the area
under notice here. For Staffordshire, Garner records
about 51 species, few of which are localised, and those
few are outside the area.</p>

<p>In Purton’s “Midland Flora,” a fair record is given of
these plants for the Midland district, several of the species
there recorded are, however, now either assigned to other
orders as algæ or fungi, or are considered to be imperfect
states of other lichens. So far as it is possible to
judge from Purton’s records, and the observations of the
present writer, the Lichen flora of that part of Warwickshire
within the area here adopted comprises about 100
species, of which the following are some of the more noticeable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Collema nigrescens; Calcium trichiale, C. hyperellum, C.
trachelinum; Trachylia tympanella; Cladonia alcicornis, C. furcata,
C. rangifera, C. uncialis; Stereocaulon paschale; Usnea hirta;
Alectoria jubata; Evernia furfuracca: Ramulina fraxinea, R.

The Algæ.</h3>

<p class="author">BY A. W. WILLS.</p>

<p>The great class of Algæ includes the sea-weeds, together
with a large number of plants, mostly of microscopic size
and of simple cellular structure, which abound wherever
fresh water is found, whether in the form of running
streams or stagnant pools, or even as covering damp
surfaces of ground.</p>

<p>A broad subdivision of the Algæ into three groups has
been generally accepted by botanists, these being the
Rhodosporeæ (red-spored), Melanosporeæ (dark-spored),
and Chlorosporeæ (green-spored). The marine genera
are distributed over all three of these groups; the freshwater
ones belong almost exclusively to the last. The
classification of the freshwater Chlorosperms is by no
means satisfactory, but it is impossible to discuss it within
the limits of this article.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that scarcely any of the botanists
of Birmingham have made the Algæ their special study;
hence the information at our disposal is insufficient to
enable us to group the recorded species with reference to
their occurrence in the several adjacent counties. This
is, however, the less important because the distribution of
this class of plants is not dependent, to the same extent
as that of Phænogams, either on climate or soil, though
it is probably not altogether independent of either.
Their abundance, therefore, is in pretty direct proportion
to that of such spaces of water as afford favourable
conditions for their growth.</p>

<p>Hence, as the neighbourhood of Birmingham is mostly
characterised by light and porous soils, the habitats in
which Algæ are to be found are somewhat restricted.
There are, however, two conspicuous exceptions. The
tract of land about seven miles from Birmingham, known
as Sutton Park, embraces a singular variety of scenery
and presents conditions highly favourable to algoid
growth in the shape of clear springs and streams, l<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>arge
sheets of water, and a considerable area of peaty bogs.
Again, the mining district of South Staffordshire and
Worcestershire, popularly known as the Black Country,
affords among its pit-banks a great number of pools which
are seldom dried up even in the hottest summer, and
many of which are partially fed by water from adjacent
mines or engines. Their number has been much
diminished during the last few years by the operations
of the South Staffordshire Mines Drainage Commission,
but is still very large and these constitute a rich hunting
ground to the student of freshwater Algæ.</p>

<p>The brief notes which follow must be regarded merely
as an indication of the general character of this branch
of the Midland Flora. Any attempt systematically to
enumerate the recorded species would far exceed the
necessary limits of this notice.</p>

<p>The great group of so-called Unicellular Algæ is
universally distributed, and the familiar forms included
under the ill-defined genera of Pleurococcus, Glœocystis,
Tetraspora, Pediastrum, &amp;c., are found abundantly in this
district wherever conditions favourable to their growth are
present. Among these low forms may be mentioned
<i>Apiocystis Brauniana</i>, parasitic on larger Algæ in stagnant
pools; the extremely rare <i>Mischococcus confervicola</i>, recorded
as found near Stafford, and <i>Polyedrium tetrahedricum</i>
found on decaying leaves in a small pit near
Sutton. <i>Ophiocytium cochleare</i>, until lately regarded as a
very scarce plant, is not uncommon in similar habitats.</p>

<p>The remarkable <i>Hydrodictyon utriculatum</i>, popularly
known as “Water Net,” appeared some years ago in
Blackroot Pool, Sutton Park, in enormous quantities, but
shortly disappeared and has not been seen there since.
It has also been recorded by Mr. T. Bolton as found in
Bourne Pool, near Aldridge.</p>

<p>The large tribe of Volvocineæ is represented by the
well-known forms of Gonium, Pandorina, and Eudorina,
and by the typical <i>Volvox globator</i>, which, as is its wont,
occasionally appears in some of the pools of the district
in great profusion, only to vanish as capriciously. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Bolton has recorded the rare and interesting <i>Volvox
globator</i> ♂,&mdash;the <i>Sphærosira volvox</i> of Ehrenberg&mdash;as
occurring in the small pool in the gravel pit near Blackroot
Pool, Sutton Park.</p>

<p>Passing to the Zygnemaceæ, Vaucheriaceæ and other
filamentous Algæ, we find a large number of species of
Zygnema, Spirogyra, Zygogonium, Mesocarpus, Staurocarpus,
Vaucheria, &amp;c., occupying ditches, small pools and
other stagnant waters; it is scarcely possible to take a
bottleful of water from these stations in summer and
autumn without finding examples of the curious modes of
reproduction characteristic of these genera.</p>

<p>In running streams and in the still ponds of the
district the long fronds of Enteromorpha, the dense tresses
of brilliant green Cladophoræ and the graceful tufts of
Stigeoclonium and Chætophora abound. The exquisite
<i>Cœtophora endiviæfolia</i> reappears at intervals in Keeper’s
Pool, Sutton Park; this species has also been found by
Mr. Bolton in an old gravel pit at Hill Hook and in
Earlswood reservoir.</p>

<p>The elegant <i>Bulbochœte setigera</i> is met with in small
fragments in stagnant pools, and the singular <i>Coleochœte
scutata</i> is to be found adherent to submerged water weeds.</p>

<p>The tepid waters of the South Staffordshire coal district
are specially favourable to the growth of Oscillatorieæ,
which form on their margins immense sheets of the deepest
green velvet.</p>

<p>Several species of Batrachospermum (among which
<i>B. atrum</i> is locally the rarest, having been found at
Halesowen only) occur in small masses in clear streams,
but they must be regarded as somewhat scarce plants.
<i>Lemania fluviatilis</i> should be mentioned as common in
the Avon and Severn, and the very rare <i>Bangia atropurpurea</i>
as occurring on a water wheel in the former
river at Stratford-on-Avon, although these habitats are
somewhat beyond the limits contemplated in this sketch.</p>

<p>The Diatomaceæ of the neighbourhood do not appear
to have been the objects of systematic study, and the
only species of special interest which we remember to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
have found is the wonderful <i>Bacillaria paradoxa</i>, well
known as a remarkable microscopic object from the
strange manner in which its linear frustules glide over one
another, so that the whole plant is incessantly assuming
a different form. It has been found by Mr. Bolton, along
with many other species, in a disused arm of the canal
near Albion Station, and by the writer in a small stream
near the same spot. A careful search would doubtless
result in the discovery of a large number of representative
species of this class.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we turn for a moment to the very
beautiful tribe of Desmidieæ, and, although the district
by no means abounds in the peaty bogs which are their
especial haunts, a goodly list of ordinary species has been
recorded. Sutton Park is the best locality for these plants,
and in addition to the commoner forms of Micrasterias,
Euastrum, Closterium, &amp;c., which are here found in
abundance, this habitat has yielded many rare and several
new species, among which the following are worthy of
special notice, viz.:&mdash;<i>Micrasterias papillifera</i>, <i>M. Cruxmelitensis</i>,
<i>M. angulosa</i>, <i>M. denticulata</i>, var. <i>lichmoides</i>,
and <i>M. Americana, forma major</i>; <i>Cosmarium coronatum</i>,
<i>Closterium directum</i>, <i>Cl. angustatum</i>, and <i>Cl. Pritchardianum</i>;
<i>Penium closteriodes</i>, <i>P. Jenneri</i>, and <i>P.
Nägeli</i>.</p>

<p>A more detailed list of species is inadmissible, but the
foregoing brief sketch will suffice to show that the Freshwater
Algæ of the neighbourhood are tolerably abundant,
and by no means devoid of interest.</p>

The Fungi.</h3>

<p class="author">BY W. B. GROVE, B.A.</p>

<p>The district of which Birmingham is the centre is in
some ways peculiarly interesting to a British Mycologist.
It was the scene of the labours of two students of British
Fungi who will always hold an honourable place in the
history of the development of the science in this country&mdash;William
Withering and Thomas Purton.</p>

<p>Withering was in his time (1741-1799) the foremost
physician of this town. He lived for many years at
Edgbaston Hall, a residence still situated among picturesque
scenery just on the edge of the town, and then no
doubt a wilder and more productive spot than now.
Many species and varieties of Fungi new to Britain or
new to science rewarded his constant researches in the
park surrounding the hall, and some of the forms which
he described still linger in this retreat. Packington Park,
about ten miles from the town, is another locality frequently
quoted by him; in fact by far the great majority of the
species found by Withering himself came from these two
places.</p>

<p>Withering enjoys the distinction of being one of the
earliest authors on the British Flora, who devoted to the
Fungi a space even decently comparable with that devoted
to the Flowering plants. In his “Arrangement of British
plants” (3rd edition), 1286 species of Phanerogams are
recorded, and 566 of Fungi, which thus fill more than
one-third as much space as their superiors in rank.</p>

<p>Thomas Purton was a surgeon of Alcester, a town about
18 miles from Birmingham. In his “Midland Flora”
(1817-1821), he gives descriptions of over 400 species of
Fungi, found chiefly in the neighbourhood of Alcester,
especially in Oversley Wood and Ragley Park. He provides
moreover excellent coloured engravings of 35
species. Since the whole number of Flowering Plants
recorded by Purton from the Midlands is only 798, it will
be seen that he surpasses Withering in devoting more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
half as much space to the Fungi as to the Phanerogams.</p>

<p>Mrs. Russell, of Kenilworth, made, a few years since,
a nearly exhaustive study of the Hymenomycetes of Kenilworth,
Stoneleigh, and Warwick, and bequeathed to the
British Museum her valuable series of over 300 coloured
illustrations. But with this exception little has been done
recently to elucidate the Fungi of the neighbourhood of
this town, until the subject was taken up, within the last
few years, by Mr. J. E. Bagnall and the writer. On reckoning
up the number of species now known to occur in this
district it will be found that they considerably exceed 900.
It is probable that the district is as productive as any
other in the smaller and microscopic kinds, but the larger
species of Fungi are, with few exceptions, not to be found
in any great abundance.</p>

<p>From want of sufficient material, it is not possible to
treat this group successfully, as has been done with the
Phanerogams, according to the counties. It will be
preferable merely to string together short notices of a
few of the more remarkable or uncommon kinds, according
to the orders into which the class “Fungi” is divided.
The names are those of Stevenson’s “Hymenomycetes
Britannici,” so far as it is published, and of Cooke’s
“Handbook” or “Grevillea” for the rest.</p>

<p>The first and most conspicuous of these orders is the
Hymenomycetes, the mushroom and toad-stool family, of
which the common mushroom may be taken as the type.
These are all distinguished by having the spore-bearing
cells arranged in a more or less continuous exposed surface,
even or variously folded. In the more typical species,
this surface assumes the form of the flat laminæ which
are termed gills. Of these, <i>Agaricus nitidus</i> has been
found at Coleshill Pool; the yellow variety of <i>Ag.
cepæstipes</i> at Sutton Coldfield; <i>Ag. polystictus</i> and <i>Ag.
pessundatus</i>, near Kenilworth; <i>Ag. stans</i> in Edgbaston
Park; <i>Ag. virgatus</i>, both there and at Coleshill Pool;
<i>Ag. inornatus</i> at Kenilworth; <i>Ag. tuba</i>, at Middleton;
<i>Ag. ditopus</i>, there and in Edgbaston Park; <i>Ag. platyphyllus</i>
frequently in and near Sutton Park; <i>Ag. rancidus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
at Middleton; <i>Ag. pullatus</i>, at Coleshill Pool; <i>Ag.
leucogalus</i>, at New Park, Middleton; <i>Ag. electicus</i>, on rush
stems in Sutton Park; <i>Ag. subpalmatus</i>, at Kenilworth
and near Studley Castle; <i>Ag. petaloides</i>, var. <i>spathulatus</i>,
at Oversley; <i>Ag. volvaceus</i>, <i>Ag. speciosus</i>, and <i>Ag.
umbrosus</i>, at Kenilworth; <i>Ag. jubatus</i>, near Barnt Green;
<i>Ag. heteroclitus</i>, many striking and well developed
specimens at Sutton Coldfield; and <i>Ag. lanuginosus</i>, in
Oversley Wood. <i>Ag. horizontalis</i> is said by Purton to be
“not rare” near Alcester, and he records <i>Ag. erinaceus</i>
and <i>Ag. pezizoides</i> from the same locality. <i>Ag. echinatus</i>,
with its remarkable blood-red gills, is found frequently at
Sutton Coldfield. At this point in the systematic order
comes in the mysterious <i>Ag. versicolor</i> of Withering, of
which he found only a few specimens in Edgbaston Park,
and which has never since been seen by any other author;
yet neither Fries nor the others venture to omit it, because
Withering gives so clear and unmistakeable a description
as almost to preclude the possibility of error. <i>Ag. luteonitens</i>
and <i>Ag. sarcocephalus</i> have been found at Kenilworth;
<i>Ag. udus</i> is common in Sutton Park and the
neighbourhood, and is also found among the Lickey Hills,
accompanied in the latter place by the variety <i>polytrichi</i>.
<i>Ag. areolatus</i> has been found at Warwick; <i>Ag. atrorufus</i>
at Sutton; <i>Ag. retirugis</i> at Kenilworth and Middleton;
and Bolton’s <i>Ag. cinctulus</i> (“History of Funguses,”
tab. 152), which is omitted by Fries as possibly incorrectly
figured, is said by Purton to be “not rare” near Alcester.</p>

<p>Of the genera allied to Agaricus, the rare species found
here are rather few. The district seems to be especially
ill supplied with the larger Cortinarii. Scarcely more than
thirty species of this genus are recorded, of which the
following may be mentioned:&mdash;<i>Cortinarius cyanipes</i>, from
Kenilworth; <i>C. callochrous</i>, from Edgbaston; <i>C. scaurus</i>,
from Packington; <i>C. violaceus</i>, which seems to have been
found by Purton; <i>C. callisteus</i> and <i>C. ochroleucus</i>, from
Kenilworth; <i>C. sanguineus</i>, in Sutton Park; <i>C. bulbosus</i>,
from Oversley; <i>C. armillatus</i>, at Coleshill Pool; <i>C.
brunneus</i> (recorded only by Withering among British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
authors), in Packington Park; and <i>C. hemitrichus</i>, in
Sutton Park.</p>

<p>The other gilled genera may be briefly dismissed.
<i>Gomphidius viscidus</i> and <i>G. glutinosus</i> have both occurred
in the district. Lactarii are not uncommon. <i>L. deliciosus</i>
is frequent in a certain part of Sutton Park, and is recorded
by both Withering and Purton; it also occurs at
Hagley and at Bromsgrove Lickey, but is very local. <i>L.
turpis</i>, of large size, abounds in several woods in the
neighbourhood of Sutton; <i>L. cilicioides</i>, <i>L. uvidus</i>, <i>L.
hysginus</i>, <i>L. zonarius</i>, <i>L. pyrogalus</i>, <i>L. glyciosmus</i>, and
<i>L. camphoratus</i>, in addition to the more common species,
have all been found; as also <i>Russula delica</i>, <i>R. rosacea</i>,
<i>R. citrina</i>, <i>R. lutea</i>, and the very rare <i>R. drimeia</i>,
<i>Hygrophorus chrysodon</i> and <i>H. russo-coriaceus</i> have been
found at Kenilworth; Purton found the pretty little
<i>Marasmius Hudsoni</i>; <i>Lentinus tigrinus</i> is recorded by
Withering, from Packington Park; <i>L. adhœrens</i> by both
Withering and Purton; and <i>L. lepideus</i> and <i>L. cochleatus</i>
have been met with several times. <i>Panus conchatus</i> was
found by Withering at Edgbaston, and by Purton at
Studley, and the writer has found <i>P. torulosus</i> in
Packington Park.</p>

<p>Among the pore-bearing Hymenomycetes, the most
striking and rare is <i>Boletus (Strobilomyces) strobilaceus</i>,
found at “the Valley,” Bromsgrove, in 1861. <i>Boletus
badius</i> is rather common, and is an edible species. The
rare <i>B. parasiticus</i> has been found at Middleton;
<i>B. striæpes</i> and <i>B. olivaceus</i> are also on record. The
writer has found the true <i>Polyporus frondosus Fr.</i> once in
Sutton Park, and fine specimens of <i>P. giganteus</i> in
Edgbaston Park. Purton records <i>P. heteroclitus</i> from
Oversley, and <i>P. molluscus</i> is occasionally found at Sutton
and Coleshill Pool. The curious <i>Ptychogaster albus</i>, which
is now usually considered a conidial form of a Polyporus,
called <i>P. ptychogaster</i>, has occurred in Sutton Park on
stumps of firs. <i>Trametes gibbosa</i> is found at Sutton;
<i>Dædalea confragosa</i> in the coppice near Windley Pool;
and the edible <i>Fistulina hepatica</i> is occasionally me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>t with
on old oaks in Sutton Park, Hagley Park, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Dismissing the rest of the Hymenomycetes, in which
there is little worthy of mention to record, we come to
the Gastromycetes, or Puff-ball family, in which the spore-bearing
surface is more or less concealed within an outer
coating, and most frequently breaks up into a dusty mass.
The Myxomycetes, which were formerly included in this
group, will here be placed in their proper position at the
end of the Fungi. Of the aberrant group to which the
common Stinkhorn (not very common in this district)
belongs, the more brilliant <i>Cynophallus caninus</i> is recorded
by Purton, from near Bridgnorth, and was found
at Bromsgrove Lickey, in 1856. The very rare and
remarkable Earth-star, <i>Geaster coliformis</i>, has not been
found in the district to which this notice is limited, but
it has been twice found in the county of Worcester. The
localities are given as “near Hanley Castle, Worcestershire,”
<i>Mr. Ballard</i>, by Withering; and “Hanley Common,
Worcestershire,” <i>Mr. Rufford</i>, by Purton. In the same
place <i>Geaster fornicatus</i> occurred, and this is said by
Withering to have been found also “at Birches Green,
near Birmingham.” <i>G. limbatus</i> is recorded from
Edgbaston Park, Stonebridge, Allesley, Oversley, and
Rushford.</p>

<p>Another group of Fungi is that which grows upon
living leaves, the various forms of which are known as
Cluster-cups, Rust, Smut and Brand. These are what
are usually called Leaf-Fungi. Many species are common
here; but, as most kinds grow only upon certain specified
plants, it follows that their range is determined in great
measure by the presence or absence of their hosts.
<i>Podisoma sabinæ</i> and <i>P. juniperi</i> have been found in the
district. The only rare cluster-cup recorded is <i>Œcidium
depauperans</i>, which occurs every summer on cultivated
Violas in a few localities, and in one of these it is uniformly
accompanied and followed by the Puccinia, to which the
name of <i>Puccinia ægra</i> has been given by the writer.
Till lately this Œcidium was not known to occur out of
the United Kingdom, but Professor Trelease, of St. Lou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>is,
in a private letter says that he has recently seen in the
United States specimens apparently identical with it. <i>Puccinia
sonchi</i> was found by Mr. Hawkes, near Great Barr,
on seedlings of Sonchus, and as yet has not been found
anywhere else in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The species of the next group, the Discomycetes, or
Cup-fungi, are not uncommon, though few of the showy
forms are to be seen. The common Morell occurs,
sparingly in the district, and <i>Morchella semilibera</i> is
recorded from Badsey. <i>Helvella crispa</i>, <i>H. lacunosa</i>, <i>H.
elastica</i>; <i>Mitrula paludosa</i>; <i>Spathularia flavida</i>; <i>Leotia
lubrica</i>; <i>Geoglossum glabrum</i>, <i>G. hirsutum</i>, and <i>Rhizina
undulata</i> have all been found, though rarely. Among the
minuter species may be mentioned <i>Peziza dematiicola</i>,
of which the writer found a few specimens at Sutton
two years ago, this being the first and at present the only
locality cited, since the place where the original specimens
of Berkeley were discovered is unknown. <i>P. asperior</i> has
been found at Berkswell (the only British locality); the
curious <i>P. Curreiana</i>, on rush stems in Sutton Park and
elsewhere; and the rare <i>P. Crouani</i>, <i>P. Dalmeniensis</i>, <i>P.
stereicola</i>; <i>Ascobolus minutissimus</i>; <i>Vibrissea leptospora</i>;
<i>Propolis pyri</i>, and a new species which Mr. Phillips has named
<i>Dermatea nectrioides</i>, at various places in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The next group of Fungi is the Pyrenomycetes or Globe-fungi.
They occur usually on dead bark and wood, or
stalks of plants, and are mostly black, more rarely red or
brown. Several common species look like grains of gunpowder
scattered over the wood. Among these Withering
mentions no species at all rare from this district, and
Purton only three&mdash;<i>Melogramma Bulliardi</i>, <i>M. gastrinum</i>,
and <i>Sphæria pomiformis</i>. To these may be added
<i>Nectria mammoidea</i> and <i>Hypomyces candicans</i> from near
Sutton; <i>Eutypa velutina</i> and <i>E. scabrosa</i> from Berkswell;
<i>Valsa cincta</i> Fr., <i>V. aglæostoma</i>, and <i>Sphæria ampullasca</i>,
from Sutton; <i>Lophiostoma angustilabra</i>, from
Middleton; and the interesting <i>Gymnoascus ruber</i>, which
affords a glimpse of the mode by which the Pyrenomycetes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
were evolved, has appeared in Birmingham itself.</p>

<p>Of the Mucorini or Pin-mould family, to which belongs
the pin-shaped mould, so common on decaying
meat&mdash;two species of Pilobolus, <i>P. œdipus</i> and <i>P. Kleinii</i>,
remarkable for their extraordinary explosive power, have
been found here and nowhere else in the kingdom.
The same is true of two species of Mortierella, <i>M.
Candelabrum</i> and <i>M. polycephala</i>, of which even the genus
is not known from any other British locality.</p>

<p>Lastly we come to the Myxomycetes, a group which,
though distinctly fungal, approximates in some degree to
the animal kingdom. These are rather abundant here,
nearly one third of the British Species having been found;
including the rare <i>Didymium pertusum</i>; <i>Badhamia
hyalina</i>; <i>Enerthenema papillatum</i>; <i>Dictydium umbilicatum</i>;
<i>Cribraria aurantiaca</i>; <i>Arcyria cinerea</i>, and <i>Prototrichia
flagellifera</i>. Worthy of especial notice is <i>Physarum
leucophæum</i> Fr., hitherto only known as British by specimens
published by Cooke in his “Fungi Britannici.” The
writer has found this at Sutton in abundance, and
identifies it with the heretofore unidentified <i>Trichia
rubiformis</i> of Purton, whose description is accompanied
by an exceedingly accurate and picturesque plate (“Midland
Flora,” tab. 37.)</p>

<p>Besides the groups of Fungi enumerated above, there
are others more obscure and consequently less interesting
to many students, of which no mention will be made here,
although numerous rare or undescribed species belonging
to them have been found in the district within recent
years.</p>

<p><b>Chains, Cables, and Anchors.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Benjamin
Hingley</span>, M.P.]&mdash;(B. 99). The manufacture of chains, cables, and
anchors is carried on at Tipton, and to a much larger extent at
Netherton, and in the neighbourhood of Old Hill near Dudley. The
manufacture of chain cables in their present form, namely, with
elongated links supported by a bar or stud in the centre of each link
is of comparatively modern origin; there are Naval men still living
who remember that Men-of-War and Merchant Ships were fitted with
hempen cables of large diameter, which occupied a considerable
space in the fore-hold of the ship. The British Fleet in Nelson’s
fighting days knew not chain cables, but was encumbered with large
coils of hempen rope.</p>

<p>It is certain that iron chains of some description were known and
used in the days of the Romans, as it is recorded that Julius Cæsar
could not cut the cables of the vessels of the Gauls, because they
were made of iron. Such chains were doubtless a succession of iron
rings, or “S” hooks of comparatively small size. It is believed that
the first chain cable was used on a British Ship, in the year 1808. It
was made by a blacksmith named Robert Flinn, at North Shields, for
a vessel which at that time was reckoned to be of a considerable size,
namely, the “Ann and Isabella.” of 221 tons. It not only saved that
vessel when in peril, but also saved a whole tier of ships that had
been made fast to her, their hempen cables having been cut by the
ice, owing to a great flood with much ice in the Tyne. This notable
instance gave a great impetus to the making of chain cables on the
banks of the Tyne, where it is still carried on to a considerable
extent.</p>

<p>At about the same date, Samuel Brown, afterwards Sir Samuel
Brown, a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, having, it is said, been in
communication with Flinn, and taken a great interest in Flinn’s iron
cables, took out a patent, and in the year 1810 he prevailed upon the
British Admiralty to put iron cables on several Men-of-War, with
such successful results that the days of hempen cables became
numbered; Lieutenant Brown afterwards devoted his attention to the
making of chain cables, and established a manufactory at Millwall on
the Thames, he also, with the assistance of “John Rennie, an
Engineer,” constructed an efficient testing machine as he “was of
opinion that there was nothing more essential in completing an iron
cable than the most rigid attention to proving.”</p>

<p>The manufacture of chain cables naturally commenced on the sea
coast, and it rapidly spread from the Tyne and Wear, where it first
commenced, to London, Liverpool, Bristol, and to Aberdeen, and
Irvine in Scotland. It may be said, that up to the year 1820,
although chain making was a local industry in the district of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span> Birmingham,
it was confined to small welded chains in the form of
elongated rings, for farming and domestic purposes; but about the
year 1820 a new impetus was given to it by the late Mr. Noah Hingley,
who then carried on business as a nail master and dealer in small
chains at Cradley Heath near Dudley. He in the course of his business
made periodical visits to the Port of Liverpool, travelling sometimes
by the Stage Coach, and at other times on horseback, and there, one
of the new chain cables, with a stud in the centre of each link,
attracted his attention. He at once resolved to develop the trade
in Staffordshire, and without hesitation made a contract to supply to
a Liverpool ship owner, a chain cable made of iron 1½ inch diameter
to be used in lieu of an hempen one. It was a bold venture, as no
workman in the Midland district had ever seen a chain of such large
size, or one fitted with studs, but after a few trials a workman with
the assistance of two strikers, and two boys to blow the bellows,
succeeded in turning out a good chain cable which was duly delivered
in Liverpool, and did good service on board ship. The making of this
first chain cable was a source of wonder in the district, and people
came from far and wide to see it.</p>

<p>Mr. Hingley afterwards introduced the making of anchors in a
similar manner&mdash;bringing men from Liverpool with a knowledge of
the trade, and afterwards erecting the first Nasmyth’s steam hammer
for that purpose in the Staffordshire district, namely, at Netherton
Ironworks, near Dudley.</p>

<p>Mr. Hingley lived to see the chain cable and anchor trade developed
to a large extent, and by several eminent firms who engaged
in the business in and about Dudley; he also took part in the
establishment of efficient public testing machines at Netherton and
at Tipton, under the authority of an Act of Parliament, making compulsory
the testing of cables and anchors for British ships. The
machines in question are under the control of the Board of Trade,
and of Lloyd’s Registry of British and Foreign shipping, and are
of the most powerful description. One of the machines at Netherton
is not only capable of testing, but also of breaking for experimental
purposes, a chain made of bar iron 4 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The manufacture of anchors and cables is now almost exclusively
located in Staffordshire, having entirely left the sea coast except at
Newcastle-on-Tyne. The making of chain cables and anchors is for
the most part carried on in factories and exclusively by men and boys
with the aid of machinery, but the smaller chains for a variety of
purposes, and especially trace chains, are made to a large extent by
women and girls in shops attached to the cottages. There are many
hundreds, probably a thousand or two, of the shops in question spread
around the district of Cradley Heath and Old Hill in the county of
Stafford. It cannot be said that such work is unsuitable for women
and girls within certain limits; but there is no doubt that close inspection
under the Workshops Act is necessary, and that there should
be strict limitations of the hours of labour. The tendency <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>is not only
to work children of tender years, but to do so until late at night,
especially at the end of the week, to make up for lost time in the
earlier part of the week. It is computed that the Staffordshire chain
and anchor trade as a whole consumes annually about 50,000 to
70,000 tons of iron, according to the state of trade, and the annual
value, when trade is fair, approaches one million sterling. The workpeople
earn from five shillings per week&mdash;the wages of a woman or
girl&mdash;to fifty shillings per week, the wages of a large cable maker.
It is a singular fact that anchor makers are to a considerable extent
either Irish or of Irish origin, the descendants of the original stock
imported from Liverpool by the late Mr. Noah Hingley. Their work
is laborious and the wages continue high, varying from thirty to sixty
shillings per week, and for the most part they spend it freely.</p>

<p><b>Die Sinking.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">G. Sherriff Tye.</span>]&mdash;(B. 560.)
For brooches, buttons, &amp;c., a block of iron is moulded by the forger
on to which a piece of cast steel is welded. Medal dies are all
steel, as the powerful pressure applied would flatten them were they
of iron. When a sharp blow is given, instead of pressure, the part-steel
die stands the blow well, though it will not withstand a
squeeze. While the steel is soft the die is cut out with steel cutting
tools and finished by gravers, previous to the final polishing. The
die sinkers of Birmingham make dies for the following purposes, among
others: buttons, military ornaments, brassfoundry, plated wares, tea
trays and tin work, gun work and small iron work, medals and coins,
jewellery, seals for wax and paper embossing, brass dies for paper
wrappers and bands, as used in the wholesale linen trades; needles,
papers, etc., wheels and rolls for ornamenting metal tubes or sheets.</p>

<p><b>Saddlery Trade.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Thomas Middlemore.</span>]&mdash;(B. 463).
<i>Obsolete Articles of Manufacture.</i>&mdash;The articles supplied
by the Saddlery trades being for use rather than for ornament, it
follows that fashion can have little effect in making any of them
obsolete. Old wants have still to be satisfied.</p>

<p>It is yet worth noticing that whilst a very large trade was done
some 30 years ago in shot belts, shot and cap pouches, and powder
flasks, this trade has now become practically obsolete, since the
breechloader has superseded the muzzleloader. Cartridges, both for
military and sporting purposes, are now carried in a bag, or a bandolier,
<i>i.e.</i>, a shoulder or waist belt, to which is fastened transversely a
series of pockets, each of which holds a cartridge.</p>

<p><i>New varieties introduced.</i>&mdash;For welts of saddles, “hide bellies”
split very thin have for the most part taken the place of seal
skins. Crocodile skins have been used occasionally for saddles
with indifferent success, but for bags, purses and pocket books, they,
along with snake skins, have been largely and successfully employed.
Calf skins for the latter purposes have been superseded by hides
split specially thin. Kangaroo skins are now used in the whip trade
for covering whips, but still more for making the whip thong. Hog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
skins, for which formerly the sole use was the saddle manufacture, are
now prepared for furniture purposes, bookbinding, and bags. They
have the advantages of being very durable, and of having a unique
and handsome grain.</p>

<p><i>Saddles</i>&mdash;The old “spring bar,” to which the stirrup leather is
fastened, is gradually giving way to the “safety bar,” the object of
which is to release the rider in the event of a fall, and to remove
the danger of his being dragged, which is an universally admitted
fault of the old “spring bar.” Further, increased safety is secured
to lady riders by various “safety stirrups” which render dragging
by the foot impossible. For the comfort of the horse the following
inventions are worth notice:&mdash;“Gaussen’s corrugated rubber pannels”
which break the jar caused by the weight of the rider&mdash;“Inflated
air pannels,” which have the same effect&mdash;“ventilating pannels,”
which are at the same time movable; these last prevent the
danger of sore backs, and are very readily cleaned; they promise to
become of general use.</p>

<p><i>Harness.</i>&mdash;The changes that have here taken place concern rather
the furniture or metal work, than the general form. For cheaper
kinds of harness, electro-plating has superseded close plating.
Again, electro-plating in its turn is being superseded by the new
white metals, which are alloys having the colour of silver, and of
analogous composition to German silver. The advantages of the
new metals are, that they are uniform in their composition, and
therefore durable, cheap, and of good appearance.</p>

<p><i>Military.</i>&mdash;The regulation saddle of 20 years back, called the
“Nolan,” has been superseded by an “Iron Arch Saddle,” and now
another regulation, introduced in 1884, made entirely of steel, with
the exception of the wooden side bars, is being used along with the
“Iron Arch Saddle.” The old “knapsack” has given place to the
new “Valise Equipment,” which was designed to distribute the
weight of the pack more evenly. On the introduction of the Camel
Corps, a special equipment was designed. Large quantities of this
pattern were used in the Egyptian campaign.</p>

<p><i>Travelling Appointments.</i>&mdash;The “Gladstone Bag,” a combination
of a bag and portmanteau, has become more popular than any kind
of either the one or the other. Tin Boxes have quite replaced the
old wooden trunks. The quality has, however, of late years, been
so reduced in order to force a sale, that unquestionably a reaction
has set in against them. When damaged they are unsightly, and
cannot be repaired. Baskets covered with canvas or leather are
now, in consequence of their cheapness, lightness, and strength,
much used for ladies’ travelling trunks. The introduction of Bicycles
and Tricycles has created a new and vast trade in saddles, satchels,
and the like for wheelmen. The trade is now only second in importance
to that for ordinary English riding saddles.</p>

<p><i>Increase since 1865.</i>&mdash;In the year 1864, the declared value of the
exports of saddlery and harness for the United Kingdom was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
£345,419. For the year 1885, the total value was only £385,687.
This increase, of less than 12 per cent., compares unfavourably with
that of the sixteen years from 1849 to 1865, which was more than
300 per cent. The exports for the first four months of the present
year were £122,093, which is less than the exports for the same
period in 1865 by £8,569. This declining prosperity, which has
occurred during the past five years, is due to a strangled trade in
South Africa, and droughts in Australasia. Good seasons, and a
rise in the wool market, give promise of an immediately better
future for the saddlery trade.</p>

<p><i>Effects of the spread of Civilization on Supply of Raw Material.</i>&mdash;The
most noteworthy fact in the leather trade, with regard to the
spread of civilization upon its supply of material, is furnished by
the basils now sent in enormous quantities from the Australasian
Colonies. Before 1865, a sheep was grown simply for its fleece,
and tallow. Of late years the skin has been tanned, and converted
into a basil. These Colonial basils supply a demand which the
home production has, of late years, failed to satisfy. The Colonial
basils are excellent in colour and texture. If they were tanned
in larch instead of the native mimosa bark, they could scarcely
be further improved. The increase of competition has, during
the past twenty years, led to the adulteration of leather. The
adulterants most used are glucose and barytes. Such adulteration
is now so general, that large consumers of leather are compelled
to avail themselves of the resources of chemical science, in order
to learn the true value of the leather they buy, by ascertaining the
kind, and by estimating the quantity of the adulterant employed in
the leather tested.</p>

<p><i>New Processes introduced in Leather Dressing.</i>&mdash;The old
“Splitting” Machines have been improved, and a new kind
called the “Band Knife” has been introduced. Further Machines
for “Scouring,” “Setting,” and “Rolling” leather have been
invented, which do their work both better and cheaper than hand
labour. The currier, as a rule, welcomes these machines, since
he is thereby relieved from much hard physical toil, whilst his
special skill has an unimpaired scope, and is just that part of his
work that is best remunerated. Saddles&mdash;The sewing by Machine
has now become universal, and in point of quality is only just
inferior to hand work. Harness&mdash;The “Lock Stitch” Machine
has superseded the “Chain Stitch” Machine. The former sews
with hard wax, such as is used in handwork. Generally for all cutting,
where quantities are required, and when shaped pieces other than strips
are wanted, the steam press has superseded the hand knife.</p>

<p><i>Machinery or Hand Labour.</i>&mdash;During the last 20 years all branches
of the saddlery trades have benefited by the steadily increased
employment of machinery&mdash;this is most marked in the currying of
leather.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Effects of Improved modes of Manufacture on Cost of Production.</i>&mdash;The
articles of the saddlery trade combine so many different kinds
of material and include such a variety of labour, that no estimate
could be relied upon of the reduction of cost due to improved methods
of manufacture. The values of articles generally reckoned in money
are about 10 per cent. below the values of 1865.</p>

<p><i>Present Extent and Description of Manufacture.</i>&mdash;In regard to the
Home trade it is only needful to say that owing to the agricultural
depression of the past 10 years, the demand for saddlery has very
greatly fallen off. To some extent this falling off in bulk is supplied
by the demands of cycle riders. In the Foreign trade the past 20
years have witnessed a vast development of the demand from the South
African Colonies. This, owing to a series of seasons of drought,
to the commercial panic of the diamond fields, and to the unsettled
political state of the Colonies, has been followed by an unparalleled
state of depression, which has made the export saddlery trade one of
the most disastrously depressed of our industries. Indeed, it has been
remarked by one thoroughly conversant with the trade, that, if the
present state of things continue, Walsall, which solely depends on the
saddlery and leather trades, will, before long, wear the same look
as Bruges, with grass growing in its streets.</p>

<p><i>Effects of Foreign Tariffs.</i>&mdash;The effect of the continued high duties
in the United States has been to practically kill the English trade
both in saddlery and saddlers’ ironmongery. Since the Franco-German
war, the French tariff has been increased. This seems to
have had little effect on the saddlery trade between England and
France. Unquestionably, however, France is now losing markets
where formerly her goods were preferred to those of this country.</p>

<p><i>Where else Manufacture carried on.</i>&mdash;Since 1865, Glasgow has
ceased to be an important centre of the saddlery trade. It is now
chiefly carried on in Birmingham and Walsall, for export saddlery.
In military goods, Bermondsey competes with Birmingham and
Walsall.</p>

<p><i>Approximate Number of Persons employed in this Town and
District.</i>&mdash;<i>Men, Women, Boys, and Girls.</i>&mdash;No satisfactory statement
can now be made, as the present time is one of exceptional
depression.</p>

<p><i>Average Earnings.</i>&mdash;Speaking generally there has been a
reduction in money wages of about 10 per cent. This wage
reckoned in commodities, of course, represents a substantial improvement,
as compared with 1865. In good times the workman
was never so well remunerated, and, on the other hand, his
employer so poorly rewarded.</p>

<p><i>Social Condition of Workpeople.</i>&mdash;No remark need be made
in regard to the improvement of his social condition which
the saddler has shared with those of other trades. The Factory
Acts have practically ended the employment of children. The
trade hardly knows the “half-timer.” The new Patents Act has
proved a great stimulus to the invention of the workman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Utilisation of Waste.</i>&mdash;If the past 5 years have been disastrous for
the saddlery trade, misfortune has yet taught its lessons. Chief
amongst these are an economical use of material, and the utilisation
of waste. The belly and shoulder parts of hides, which used
often to be sent to market, are now mostly consumed, thus saving
capital and enabling a cheaper article to be produced. Again, the
scrap leather, which is necessarily created by even the most careful
cutting, is now utilised in making goods of extraordinary cheapness.
A splitting machine for dividing pieces of leather, however small,
into any required number of thicknesses, is of great help to this end.
When leather is reduced in size below what is required for any
article of commerce, it is then used either for hardening purposes,
or to form imitation leather when reduced to a pulp and rolled either
by itself or with rope fibre.</p>

<p><b>Chemicals.</b>&mdash;In obtaining the statistical information
on <a href="#Page_152">p. 152</a>, I am indebted in great measure to Dr. Bostock Hill,
Secretary of the Birmingham Section of the Society of Chemical
Industry.&mdash;C. J. W.</p>

<p class="center">MINERALS.
(OF THE BIRMINGHAM DISTRICT.)</p>

<p class="author">BY C. J. WOODWARD, B.SC., F.G.S.</p>

<p>The crystalline minerals occurring within the limits of
the Birmingham district may be most conveniently
referred to under the titles of the several counties in which
they actually occur. These counties are: Derbyshire,
Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire,
Oxfordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire,
Warwickshire, and Worcestershire.</p>

<p><b>Derbyshire.</b>&mdash;The mines in this county are worked
out, and there is but little opportunity of meeting with
minerals. On the spoil-banks of the old mines poor
specimens may be found. Mr. John Tym, of Castleton,
is a local dealer, and the guide to the High Tor Grotto
has minerals for sale. The following list with localities is
taken from a paper on “Economic Geology of Derbyshire,”
by Mr. A. H. Stokes, F.G.S., H.M. Inspector of
Mines. <i>Barytes</i>, nearly all lead mines, Newhaven;
<i>Blende</i>, Old hillocks, near Ashover and Hartington;
<i>Gypsum</i>, Chellaston, also railway cutting between Trent
and Loughborough; <i>Brown Hæmatite</i>, north west of
Hubberdale mine, near Taddington, also near Elton;
<i>Brown Lead Ore “Linnets,”</i> Elton, and Newhaven, Winster;
<i>Calcite</i>, colourless at lead mines of Nether Haddon, near
Bakewell. Alpart, Ashover, and Wirksworth yield good
specimens. <i>Elaterite</i>, Windy Knoll Quarry, Main Tor,
Castleton; <i>Fluor Spar</i>, Blue John and other mines, Castleton;
<i>Limonite</i>, a field, one mile north of Castleton, and
to the east of Odin Lead mine; <i>Petroleum</i>, Riddings
Colliery, near Alfreton. A sump is sunk at the bottom
of the mine, and into this the oil finds its way. Som<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>e
years as much as 100 tons of oil have been obtained at a
price as high as £7. 10s. per ton. <i>Phosgenite</i>, very scarce,
Meer Brook Sough mine, near Worksworth; <i>Pyrites</i>,
large cubic crystals at Gregory mine, near Ashover; <i>Rock
crystal</i>, Buxton, in amygdaloid cavities of toad stone; also
Diamond Hill, near Miller’s Dale station; <i>Towanite</i>, Old
hillocks at Ecton mine, Cumberland mine, Matlock Bath;
<i>Wad</i>, mines near Elton; <i>White Lead Ore</i> (<i>Cerussite</i>),
near Brassington; Heyspots mine, near Elton; Cabin
mine, Newhaven. A more extensive list of the minerals
of Derbyshire, compiled by the Rev. J. M. Mello, will
be found in “The Midland Naturalist,” Vol. iv., p. 183.</p>

<p><b>Gloucestershire.</b>&mdash;Mr. H.B. Woodward, of the
Geological Survey, has given the following list:&mdash;<i>Agate</i>,
Berkeley, Damory Bridge; <i>Barytes</i>, Tortworth; <i>Bitumen</i>,
Clifton; <i>Brown Spar</i>, Tortworth; <i>Celestine</i>, Tortworth,
Thornbury, Wickwar, Aust; <i>Fluor Spar</i>, Clifton; <i>Göthite</i>,
Clifton; <i>Jasper</i>, Tortworth; <i>Prehnite</i>, Woodford Bridge,
Berkeley; <i>Rock Salt (pseudomorphs)</i>, Aust; <i>Steatite</i>,
Tortworth; <i>Talc</i>, Tortworth; <i>Vivianite</i>, near Clifton.</p>

<p>Pyle Hill, near Clifton, is a well-known locality for
Celestine. At Garden Cliff, near Westbury-on-Severn,
the “bone bed” is well exposed, and in this bed occurs
plenty of iron pyrites; and in the shales, as might be
expected, crystals of selenite occur.</p>

<p><b>Leicestershire.</b>&mdash;<i>Gold</i> occurs in the quartz veins
round Pedlar Tor, Charnwood Forest. <i>Garnets</i> occur in
“gneiss” at Brazil Wood (Mr. W. J. Harrison). <i>Copper
pyrites</i>, <i>Molybdenum</i>, Mount Sorrel and Breedon. <i>Galena</i>,
<i>Blende</i>, Dimminsdale; <i>Dolomite</i>, Cloud Hill; <i>Gypsum</i>
and <i>Selenite</i>, various places; <i>Iron pyrites</i> in cubes,
Swithland Great Pit (Mr. James Plant).</p>

<p><b>Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire.</b>&mdash;<i>Barytes</i>,
<i>Blende</i>, <i>Calcite</i>, <i>Galena</i>, <i>Glauconite</i>, <i>Gypsum</i> (<i>Selenite</i>),
<i>Lignite</i>, <i>Limonite</i>, <i>Pyrites</i>, <i>Websterite</i>, occur in the
neighbourhood of Banbury (Mr. Thomas Beesley).</p>

<p><b>Nottinghamshire.</b>&mdash;<i>Gypsum</i> occurs in veins near
Retford, and is used for garden rock-work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Shropshire.</b>&mdash;At Lilleshall an old mine known as
the Stump Leasow, worked for limestone, yielded the
following minerals:<a name="FNanchor_67_68" id="FNanchor_67_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_68" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>&mdash;<i>Quartz</i>, a minute crystal only.
<i>Erubescite</i>, a few minute patches in the massive form.
<i>Copper Pyrites</i>, in sphenoids. <i>Iron Pyrites</i>, in radiating
masses. <i>Hæmatite</i>, in minute chocolate-coloured hemispherical
masses, also in an almost continual film containing
the calc spar and other minerals with a coppery sheen.
<i>Barytes</i>, in pink, lamellar, somewhat radiating masses.
At the free surfaces of these masses are transparent
crystals. <i>Calcite</i>, in beautiful ice-like clusters of crystals
taking the form of steep three-faced pyramids. The
groups are made up of steep scalenohedrous with rhombohedral
summits. The calcite is in some cases pink due
to manganese, a sample contained 1·20 per cent. of
MnO. In the lower measures the calcite occurs in
pointed scalenohedrous lining cavities in the stone.
<i>Dolomite</i>, is the most interesting mineral of the group.
It occurs in nodules made up of a succession of laminæ
of varying diameters, the laminæ crystallizing at the
edges in rhombs resembling pearl spar. The composition
of one sample of this dolomite is nearly identical with
what according to Boricky is one of the possible values
of Ankerite. Another approximates to the formula
3 CaCO₃ + (FeMn) CO₃ + MgCO₃ and should be
described as a ferriferous dolomite.</p>

<p>In the mining district of West Shropshire many
beautiful and interesting minerals are met with. The
district is best reached from Birmingham by taking train
to Minsterley, via Shrewsbury. At Snailbeach Mine,
near Minsterley, occur beautiful rhombs of <i>Calcite</i>, having a
violet tinge, due to a small quantity of manganese. There
are also crystals of <i>Blende</i> and <i>Galena</i>. At several of
the mines <i>Witherite</i> and <i>Barytes</i> are found, and, according
to Mr. Morton, other minerals met with are <i>Quartz</i>,
<i>Chalcedony</i>, <i>Petroleum</i>, <i>Pyrites</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> <i>Malachite</i>, <i>Redruthite</i>,
<i>Wad</i>, <i>Minium</i>, and <i>Cerussite</i>. At Wotherton, two miles
from Chirbury, is a fine barytes lode which has been
worked for more than 60 years, at first as an open mine,
and subsequently by means of a shaft. The barytes is
remarkably pure, and after grinding is sold in large
quantities. In the lode are crevices and cavities filled
with a fine mud, and penetrating into the mud are fine
transparent crystals. These crystals have been measured
by Mr. Miers, of the British Museum, and a record of
the forms present will be found in his description.<a name="FNanchor_68_69" id="FNanchor_68_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_69" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
(“Nature,” vol. xxix., p. 29.)</p>

<p>In connection with the mineralogy of Shropshire, it
should be recorded that the extremely rare instance of
the fall of an iron meteorite in the British Isles took place
in this county at Rowton, near Wellington, on April 20th,
1876. This meteorite was extracted by Mr. G. Brooks,
from the hole in which it had buried itself, and was hot
when removed. It is now in the possession of the British
Museum, and Prof. Maskelyne has given particulars of it
in “Nature,” vol. xiv., p. 472. It weighs 7 lbs. 11 oz.,
“is a mass of metallic iron irregularly angular, although
all its edges appear to have been rounded by fusion in its
transit through the air, and, except at the point where it
first struck the ground, it is covered by a thin black
pellicle of the magnetic oxide of iron … the exposed
metallic part of the surface exhibits crystalline structure
very clearly when it is etched. It is only the seventh aërosiderite
or meteoric iron of which the fall has been
witnessed, although upwards of a hundred iron masses
have been discovered in different parts of the globe, which
are undoubtedly meteoric, and two such have been found
in Great Britain.”<a name="FNanchor_69_70" id="FNanchor_69_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_70" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Warwickshire.</b>&mdash;Many years ago a pocket of <i>Grey
Oxide of Manganese</i> was found near Atherstone, but I
have been unable to find now any traces of it. <i>Gypsum</i>
occurs in the cutting of a disused railway near Henley-in-Arden,
and at Spernall (Spernall Plaster Pits), near
Alcester. Mr. A. H. Atkins has called attention to the
fact that gypsum was met with in sinking an artesian
well in Small Heath Park, near Birmingham; he also
mentions the occurrence of <i>Green Copper Carbonate</i> at
Vaughton’s Hole, near Birmingham.</p>

<p><b>Worcestershire.</b>&mdash;Dr. Harvey B. Holl mentions the
following minerals as occurring at the Malvern Hills:&mdash;<i>Quartz</i>,
<i>Orthoclase</i>, <i>Labradorite</i>, <i>Anderine</i>, <i>Potash Mica</i>,
<i>Ferruginous Mica</i> (<i>Biolite</i>), <i>Augite</i>, <i>Hornblende</i>, <i>Epidote</i>,
<i>Chlorite</i>, <i>Hæmatite</i>, <i>Calc Spar</i>, <i>Graphite</i>, <i>Zeolites</i>, and
<i>Garnet</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="hanging">[The following articles refer to subjects which could not
be included in previous papers, and which are yet
worth notice as part of the history of Birmingham.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><b>Botanical Gardens.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Sam: Timmins.</span>]&mdash;The first
proposal to establish Botanical Gardens, in accordance with
the science of horticulture of the time, was made in 1829.
Twelve acres were secured in the then rural suburb of
Edgbaston, and on the advice of the famous J. C. Loudon
four more acres were added, and the buildings erected by
Clarke of Birmingham, and opened to the public in 1831.
The original capital was 500 shares of £5 each, and an
annual payment of three guineas which secured certain
privileges of admission beyond those of the subscriber’s
payment. The institution flourished, with some vicissitudes,
for many years, but was necessarily exclusive, and
only recently have admissions been made more easy by
reduced and varying charges on different days. On
Monday&mdash;the people’s day&mdash;large numbers attend, and
the experiment has proved successful. The buildings
were recently greatly extended and rearranged from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>the
designs of Mr. Frank Osborne, and are now believed to
be amongst the best of the kingdom. Flower shows
are held during the summer, and prizes awarded, which
are eagerly contended for by numerous horticulturists
and florists of the town and neighbourhood.</p>

<p><b>Guinea Gardens.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Sam: Timmins.</span>]&mdash;Near the
Botanical Gardens a group of small gardens may be seen,
which are the only “survivals” of the acres of “allotment
gardens” or “guinea gardens,” which surrounded Birmingham
within a mile from the centre as late as 1830 to 1840.
Birmingham was, in fact, a town of gardens fifty years ago,
not merely as to the gardens attached to houses&mdash;front and
back gardens in the principal parts of the town,&mdash;but of
the groups of gardens rented by workmen and others,
who could reach their gardens easily from their homes by
a short walk, and devote mornings and evenings to them.
The sites of the Kent Street Baths, and those opposite
St. Thomas’s Church,&mdash;at Ladywood, Spring Hill, Hockley,
Handsworth, and Aston road,&mdash;all within the Parish
Boundary, formed a belt of gardens where the workman
and his family often spent the summer evenings and
enjoyed the (then) country air. All is now changed,
and the distances even by rail and tram are too great, and
land too valuable, to be let out in readily accessible
gardens for the workers of the town, who cannot for
many reasons live in the suburbs which railways have
opened since 1840.</p>

<p><b>Sunday Lecture Society.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Thos. Rose.</span>]&mdash;This
Society, which has now become one of the most successful of
our local institutions, had a very humble origin. In 1877, a
few members of the Birmingham Temperance Society (foremost
amongst whom was Mr. Thos. Hewins), conceived
the idea of holding Meetings on Sunday evenings “for the
social, moral, and intellectual improvement of the non-church
and chapel-going portion of the community.” They
accordingly formed themselves into a Committee, who
engaged the then newly erected Board Schools in Bristol
Street, for the winter season of 1877-8, and commenced
what were described as “Sunday Evening Meetings for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the People.” For a short time these meetings were of a
purely temperance character, but finding that they were
not so thoroughly appreciated as they had expected, the
Committee extended the variety of the subjects, and
lectures were delivered embracing a wide range of thought,
both moral and religious, literary and dramatic, scientific
and historical, occasionally interspersed with musical
evenings illustrative of the principal oratorios. Foremost
amongst the lecturers (who numbered many of our chief
local literary and scientific men), was Mr. Sam: Timmins,
who from the first took an active part in the movement,
the success of which was from this time assured, the
lectures being attended by crowded and appreciative
audiences every Sunday evening, and occasionally hundreds
were unable to obtain admission.</p>

<p>In 1880, the then Mayor (Alderman R. Chamberlain),
generously offered the Committee the free use of the
Town Hall, and for some months the lectures were
delivered consecutively in that place to audiences numbering
from 3 to 4,000 each Sunday. This gave rise to
considerable opposition on the part of the various religious
sects of the town against what was considered to be “a
monopoly of the use of the hall by one particular sect,”
and after much controversy in the public press, and debate
in the Town Council, the question of the letting of the
Town Hall on Sundays was left in the hands of the
Mayor for the time being, on the understanding that its
continuous use by any one sect should be refused. Thereupon
the lectures were resumed in the Bristol Street Board
School, with occasional special lectures in the Town Hall.</p>

<p>In 1881, the movement assumed a more representative
character. The then Hon. Sec. (Mr. T. Rose), assisted
by some of the leading members of the Committee, took
steps to organize a Sunday Lecture Society, and a Meeting
was held on July 1st, 1881, under the Presidency of
Mr. William Harris, J.P., when the present Society was
publicly inaugurated, the objects being&mdash;“To provide for
the delivery on Sundays in the Borough o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>f Birmingham,
and to encourage the delivery elsewhere of lectures upon
subjects calculated to promote the social, moral, and
intellectual well-being of the community at large, as
hitherto conducted by the Committee of the Sunday
Evening Meetings for the People.”</p>

<p>The constitution of the Society also provided that a
minimum subscription of One Shilling per year should
constitute membership, and that any pecuniary profit
should be applied to the further promotion of the objects
of the Society. Mr. Sam: Timmins was elected first
President, and the management of its affairs was entrusted
to a Committee of 30, exclusive of Officers, to be elected
annually from amongst the body of members.</p>

<p>In the first year of the Society’s existence the members
numbered 80, including the names of many of the most
influential public men of the town, and the subscription
list amounted to £45. 14s. 6d. The number of members
is now 168, and the subscription list amounts to £70;
the income being further augmented by the collections
taken at the various lectures (which are thus largely
self-supporting). Nearly all the lectures being given
voluntarily, the cost of working the Society is comparatively
small, and is fully met by the income
derived from subscriptions and collections. Five of
the principal Board Schools are engaged every Sunday
evening throughout the winter season, from October to
April, and at intervals special lectures are delivered in the
Town Hall. During the season from 1885 to 1886,
71 lectures were delivered at the Board Schools, with a
total attendance of 23,150, or an average of 326 to
each lecture, and 10 lectures were delivered at the Town
Hall, with a total attendance of 33,000, or an average
of 3,300 for each lecture. Ald. R. Chamberlain, M.P.,
is now President of the Society, as well as one of its
most popular lecturers. In Councillor R. F. Martineau,
the Committee possesses a most able and energetic
Chairman. Mr. W. B. Smith is the Treasurer, and Mr.
J. H. Forrester, No. 1, Summer Hill Terrace, worthily
fills the office of Hon. Secretary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Newspapers.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Sam: Timmins.</span>]&mdash;The earliest known
Birmingham Newspaper was “The Birmingham Journal,”
published by Thomas Warren, in 1733. It was at first
published on Thursdays, but afterwards on Mondays.
Only one copy has survived, that of May 21st, 1733,
No. XXVIII. The “Journal” is interesting as it shows some
traces of the style of Dr. Johnson, who very probably
assisted Warren in his newspaper. “Aris’s Birmingham
Gazette” was first published in 1741, and its original title is
used on the Saturday issue from the Daily Gazette Office to
this day. It was originally published on Mondays, and
some of its earlier issues bore another heading, for special
County circulation. “Swinney’s Birmingham Chronicle”
was published for several years, from 1796 to 1816, but
no complete file has been preserved. Jabet’s “Commercial
Herald” was issued from 1804 to 1813. The “Birmingham
Journal” was revived in 1825, by Wm. Hodgetts, and
was continued until absorbed in “The Daily Post.” The
“Birmingham Advertiser” was commenced in 1833, and
continued till 1845. In 1836, the “Midland Counties
Herald” was begun on a new plan of gratuitous circulation
and is continued as a sheet of advertisements and news
relating to the land and agricultural interests to this day.
The “Birmingham Morning News” appeared in 1871,
with George Dawson as its first editor, and was continued
till 1875.</p>

<p>“Aris’s Birmingham Gazette” was one of the first two
country papers which began a series of “Local Notes and
Queries” in 1856. The example has been very generally
followed, and the series continued in the “Weekly Post”
and the “Weekly Mercury,” and many important facts of
local history have thus been discovered and preserved.</p>

<p>The removal of the “taxes on knowledge”&mdash;the stamp
duty and advertisement duty and the paper duty&mdash;soon
produced local daily papers, the first being the “Daily
Press,” in 1855, edited for some time by George Dawson,
and followed by the “Daily Mercury.” In 1857 the
“Daily Post” was started, and in 1879 the “Daily
Globe” appeared. In 1869 the “Midland Illustrated
News” was begun, but it surv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>ived only about a year and
a half. Among the other newspapers were the “Birmingham
Chronicle” (1823); the “Midland Chronicle” (1811);
the “Philanthropist” (1835). Many other short-lived
newspapers have been issued from time to time&mdash;many
of which are to some extent preserved by odd copies in
the Reference Library, and among them a German newspaper
of which only one number appeared. Birmingham
was one of the first towns which produced a Sunday newspaper&mdash;the
“Sunday Echo,” and some others have been
issued since. The “cheap press” secured a very large
number of readers, when the first halfpenny daily evening
paper, the “Daily Mail,” was established in 1869, followed
for some time by a similar issue from the “Daily Gazette”
office, and afterwards by the “Midland Echo.”</p>

<p>Many monthly pamphlets&mdash;practically newspapers&mdash;were
issued, such as the “Independent” (1827), and
“Inspector” (1817); the “Weekly Recorder” and
“Register” (1819), by George Edmonds; and many
serials, sarcastic or humorous, have appeared from time
to time. The scurrilous “Argus” of fifty years ago, and
later the “Town Crier” (1861), “Brum,” “Graphic,”
“Dart,” “Owl,” “Free Lance,” &amp;c., with our illustrated
“Phonographic Punch,” and one local monthly, “Edgbastonia,”
in which many interesting biographies of local
celebrities have appeared. On several occasions Sunday
sermons have been published in serials such as the
“Birmingham Pulpit” (1871-73). Other attempts to
establish newspapers for discussion rather than mere
news have been tried as in the “Liberal Review” (1880).</p>

<p><b>Theatres.</b>&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Sam: Timmins.</span>]&mdash;Birmingham has been
famous as a theatrical town for nearly a century, and
especially as the “training ground” where many of the leading
actors of the present century learned their art and won
their first laurels. The stage was, however, rather a late
creation in Birmingham, and no traces are found earlier
than about 1730, when mere booths served the purpose
of a “play-house,” and actors were only “rogues and
vagabonds” according to law. “A shed in Temple
Street” and a “stable in Cas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>tle Street,” with admission
threepence each, and the small band parading the town
during the day, in the absence of newspapers, to announce
the performance, formed, according to Hutton, the “rise
of the drama” in our town. As early as 1750 travelling
circuses and theatres appeared in Coleshill Street; and in
1802 the famous Astley brought his circus to the “back
of the Stork Hotel.” In 1730 a temporary building
was erected in Moor Street, in 1743 another in New
Street, in 1747 another in Smallbrook Street, and in 1776
a more important and permanent theatre was built in
King Street&mdash;a street covered by the railway station and
Stephenson Place, and the site of the theatre being now
that of the front of the Exchange. This became an
important theatre, and existed till late in the century in
competition with the present Theatre Royal, which was
founded about the same date. The few play bills which
have survived, and the expenditure on the building, show
that every effort was made to do justice to the drama a
century ago. At this date theatres were merely
tolerated, but in 1777 an application was made for a
licence for the New Street Theatre to play for “four
months in the year,” and this application was somewhat
famous, for it was eloquently supported by Edmund
Burke, who used the phrase&mdash;since so well-known and so
little understood&mdash;that Birmingham was the “great Toy-shop
of Europe.” The phrase, however, was not new,
but was used in a book by Sir Samuel Morland a hundred
years earlier to describe the shops where trinkets and
small steel and iron wares were sold, and not in connection
with children’s “toys.” The second reading of the Bill,
to enable His Majesty the King to grant a Patent was,
however, lost, but the enterprise was continued, and in
1780 the present front of the Theatre Royal was erected
with a commodious theatre, well lighted by wax candles,
and with “the passages warmed with stoves” as the
performances were to be given in the winter as
well as the summer months. It was not till 1807
that a “Patent” was secured for the Theatre which
then became the Theatre Royal, and still remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
under the jurisdiction of the Lord Chamberlain. In
1778 a “wooden building” was erected as an “opera
house,” near the Plough and Harrow, in the Moseley
Road, but this was burned down soon after. In 1792,
the Theatre Royal was destroyed by fire, and again in
1820, but the front remained unharmed in these two great
fires and the medallions of Shakespeare and Garrick
remain as placed in 1780. In both cases the fires were
believed to be incendiary and with good reason too. In
1795 the Theatre was rebuilt and re-opened by William
Macready, who remained till 1810, in which year, on June
11, his future famous son, William Charles Macready,
appeared as Romeo,&mdash;“a young gentleman and his first
appearance on any stage.” In 1813, Macready was
followed by Elliston, as lessee, and in 1819 he was succeeded
by Alfred Bunn. During all this period all the
great actresses, and actors, and singers, and celebrities of
the time appeared on the Theatre Royal stage, and a
very complete series of Play Bills has fortunately been
preserved. The present lessee, Mr. M. H. Simpson,
and his father have had the Theatre Royal for fifty
years, and recently additions and alterations have been
made, not only in the Theatre proper, but in the accessory
rooms for actors and scenery which have never been
surpassed for extent and convenience. The Theatre
Royal was, practically, the only theatre for many years,
but in 1853 a dramatic licence was granted by the
magistrates for a building on the Bingley Hall site:
in 1856 the “Music Hall” in Broad Street was built, but
in 1862 it was converted into a theatre, and opened as
the Royal Operetta House, by Mr. W. H. Swanborough.
In 1866 it was bought by Mr. James Rodgers, and in 1876
was practically rebuilt, and additions and alterations are
now in progress under Mr. Rodgers and his Son. In 1879
a license was granted to the Holte Theatre, in the Aston
Lower Grounds; and the Grand Theatre, Corporation
Street, built and managed by Mr. Andrew Melville, was
opened November 14, 1883. In 1785 an Amphitheatre
existed in Livery Street and was converted into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span> Chapel:
in King Street the Theatre was also converted into a Chapel,
and afterwards back again to a Public Hall; and in 1827
the Circus of James Ryan, permanently built some years
later, was converted into the Circus Chapel. In short, the
great progress of Birmingham in the second half of the last
century was felt in every way: the Musical Festival
was founded, and the drama grew rapidly as the town
extended and the taste of the public improved.</p>

<h3>THE COVENTRY INDUSTRIES.</h3>

<p class="author">BY W. G. FRETTON, F.S.A.</p>

<p>An exhaustive account of the ribbon and watch manufactures
of Coventry, with technical descriptions of the
various processes involved in the treatment of the raw
material, in its progress of manufacture from its primitive
condition to its finished state, having already appeared in
the comprehensive series of articles in the midland industries,
published on the occasion of the former visit of the
Association in 1865, it only remains to note the changes
and additions which have been made since that period in
the Industries of Coventry.</p>

<p><b>Ribbon Trade.</b>&mdash;Several causes have combined to
produce a very serious decline in the manufacture of silk
fabrics, the chief of them being the French commercial
treaty, to which may be added change of fashion, and
increased competition and more rapid production by the
further development of machinery. From 1860 to 1878
the ribbon trade in Coventry and its neighbourhood, had
decreased by at least one half, and the decline has been
going on since that period, with exceptional experiences of
spasmodic improvement, ever since. Efforts have been
made in various ways to direct the textile skill of the
artisans into other channels wherein their weaving
abilities might be turned to their advantage, and the area
of textile manufactures increased. In one of these departments
may be specially noticed the manufacture of
<i>bookmarks</i>, and other illuminated ribbons. This trade was
chiefly introduced by Mr. Thomas Stevens, and has been
most successfully developed by himself and other manufacturers,
until their extent, beauty of design, variety of
application, &amp;c., have been marvellous. Portraits, valentines,
presents suitable to the seasons, birthdays, views of
noted buildings, poetical sentences, mottoes, labels, and
other decorative and descriptive ornaments have been
produced, which, half a century ago, it would have been
deemed impossible to produce from a loom. But this
has involved the construction of complicated and e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>xpensive
machinery, and has raised the art of loom-making
considerably. Such a trade is, after all, but limited, it is
the production of a luxury, a merchandise “which none
but the rich can buy.”</p>

<p><b>Trimming Trade.</b>&mdash;Another department of textile
industry which has sprung up, somewhat analogous to the
Ribbon manufacture, is the Trimming trade, for which
special looms have been adopted&mdash;cambric frilling, mainly
introduced by Messrs. Cash; bead work, and other
ornamental fabrics have also been introduced.</p>

<p><b>Cotton Spinning and Weaving.</b>&mdash;Soon after the
decline of the ribbon trade the attention of the Coventry
manufacturers was drawn to the experiment of introducing
the cotton spinning and weaving. A large factory with
suitable annexes for carrying on a large trade was erected
on the north side of the city by a company formed in 1860,
the Rev. S. H. Widdrington, then vicar of St. Michael’s,
taking a great interest in the project. Its operations have
been attended by varied success; the distance from the
centres of the cotton trade forming an obstacle to its full
development, the spinning department has received most
attention.</p>

<p><b>Elastic Web.</b>&mdash;In 1859 Messrs. Dalton and Barton
introduced the manufacture of elastic webs, but afterwards
disposed of this department of their business to Mr.
Pridmore, by whom it is still carried on at Foleshill. In
1862 a company was formed for carrying on the same
kind of trade, chiefly through the instrumentality of the
vicar of St. Michael’s, and known as the Coventry Elastic
Weaving Company, and for nearly twenty years it conducted
a large business, having branches at Red Lane,
Foleshill, and in White Friars’ Lane, Coventry. Owing
to a brisk competition in other weaving centres, and consequent
over-production, the company dissolved a few
years ago, a portion of the plant and trade being retained
by Mr. J. C. Odell, one of the members of the company,
and still successfully carried on. There are several firms
in the city conducting similar business.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Bradford Stuff Manufacture</b> was introduced
into Coventry in 1864, and established in a large disused
factory, originally erected as a cotton mill, in Hill Street,
afterwards occupied as a ribbon manufactory. The firm
is known as the “Leigh” Mills Company (Limited), the
present Lord-Lieutenant of the County having shown
much interest in the promotion of this and other new
industries in Coventry. Excellent woollen and worsted
goods are made here, silk and cotton being also used in
some of the varieties manufactured.</p>

<p><b>Coach Lace and Broad Stuffs</b> for railway and
other carriages, trimmings for furniture, &amp;c., are largely
manufactured by Messrs. Dalton and Barton, Messrs.
Perkins and Son, and others.</p>

<p><b>Silk Dyeing</b> is still carried on to a considerable
extent by several firms, and the city maintains its old
character for the permanence and brilliancy exhibited in
this class of work, which is one of the ancient staples of
the city.</p>

<p>It will be seen that while Coventry still maintains its
textile productions in the weaving industry, its works
are not confined to ribbons, and the manufacturers and
artisans generally deserve the highest commendation for
the spirit and the aptitude they have displayed in adapting
themselves to the altered circumstances of the textile
industry of the city, and the opening up of new branches
of the weaving industry has emancipated the city from
dependence on the ribbon trade alone.</p>

<p>Many firms are still engaged in the manufacture of
ribbons, sashes, ladies’ scarfs, &amp;c., and during the last
year or two, gauzes having been in demand have been
largely made.</p>

<p><b>Watch Manufacturing.</b>&mdash;Coventry is one of the
principal places in England for this branch of manufacturing
industry, and at the head of the numerous firms
engaged therein, Messrs. J. Rotherham and Sons hold
the first and oldest position. A trade of such extent,
and exhibiting so many stages of progress in its production,
necessarily possesses many features of interest,
and may be divided into the following, with mino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>r
divisions springing from them:&mdash;watch manufacturers,
case makers, engravers, springers, engine-turners, and
polishers; cap makers, dial makers, escapement, balance,
pallet, roller, and lever makers; movement, motion, index,
hand, and glass makers; fuzee cutters, gilders, examiners,
and finishers; jewellers, keyless motion and movement
makers, and motioners.</p>

<p>The trade has been subject to many changes and
fluctuations, and is at present in a depressed state, owing
largely to foreign competition, and the production of
cheap watches by means of machinery. Efforts have
been made by more than one of the Coventry firms to
meet the latter source of competition by the introduction
of machinery in the construction of various parts of the
watch, and in the subdivision of labour, more especially
in the class known as “going barrels” with various measures
of success; but for the better class of watch, the old
system bids fair to maintain its position. A project for
the establishment of technical schools for special instruction
in the various processes in connection with the
Coventry staple trades in general, and that of Horology
in particular, is still under consideration, and may lead to
satisfactory results. There are about 150 manufacturers
of watches in Coventry.</p>

<p><b>The Cycle Manufacture</b> was introduced into this
city about 20 years ago in conjunction with the making
of sewing machines. The latter branch of trade has given
place almost entirely to the former, and the reputation
which the various firms engaged in the trade have succeeded
in obtaining, have placed Coventry in the first rank
in this new and peculiar manufacture. The Coventry
Machinists’ Company (Cheylesmore) were the first to introduce
this trade into this country, and it is still one of
the largest of the producers. Among the rest may be
mentioned the Rudge, Premier, Singer and Co., Fleet,
Centaur, Meteor, Excelsior, Wellington, Victoria, and
others, all of which have some speciality claiming some
peculiar excellence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Artistic Work in Metal</b> was introduced into
Coventry chiefly by the exertions and artistic taste of
Mr. Skidmore over 30 years ago, and has been followed
out by himself, and by various Companies in the same
direction ever since. Work from the different firms
established in Coventry of great excellence, may be found
in many of the principal towns in the British Islands, and
on the Continent, notably in Lichfield and Hereford
Cathedrals, Prince Consort Memorial, Burlington House,
&amp;c. Ironfounding and agricultural implement manufacturing
has also attained a high position of excellence under
the firm of Matterson, Huxley, and Watson of this city.</p>

approach £200,000. As early as 1882, however, we find that the
Council “view with regret the narrow margin that is likely to exist
unless the present endowment is supplemented by other gifts,”&mdash;[Report,
p. 11.]&mdash;and this anxiety is again forcibly expressed in
1885. It was relieved in that year, however, by an “Additional

of the pastorate there in 1802, and, it becoming too small, it was
resolved to build Ebenezer Chapel. The chapel in Livery Street was
pulled down in 1853, and the printing establishment of M. Billing,
